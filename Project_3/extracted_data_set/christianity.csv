to defend my Christian brothers and sisters a little bit, I think there is a narrative that christians aren't loving, which I find hard to stomach. In my area we have a homeless shelter that has continued to operate over the course of the pandemic, a youth ministry that has given children a place to spend their evenings after school while also providing them a place to study and a food bank that has experienced it's greatest year of charitable giving. Each one of these ministries is faith based and having intimate knowledge of the finances of the youth ministry I can speak towards a large portion of their budget is donated by brick and mortar churches. I think there is a deep love for the oppressed, hungry and poor. 

With all that being said, I struggle mightily when I see the reactions of my Christian brothers and sisters towards the issues facing the world today. I can't reconcile why some people are pro life yet don't want to wear a mask, or ""all lives matter"" yet can't acknowledge that black lives matter, etc. I think we need to truly pray and seek Jesus for these answers and recognize that we are all sinners and not perfect. All in all I agree with what you are saying and think the churches mission should be caring for ones who need it the most, that is so clear in Jesus' teachings. I just think there are good hearted christian people who act out in sinful and sometimes hateful ways and that is so hard to understand. I guess my point is that I am quick to come to the defense of a non-christian who acts in a sinful way and it's easy to not afford our fellow christians that same mercy, when it should be afforded to them.","This pandemic has been a real eye opener for me.  The churches doors slammed shut and there was almost no impact on the surrounding communities. 

Oh, the Christians missed their weekly performance, but the public didn't feel any loss.

We obviously aren't making much difference.  The homeless and needy have given up on the churches.  They're not the source of practical help.

Nice buildings and parking lots just don't seem to be building the Kingdom of God here and now. 

The staffers have often become employees who live to appease cranky Christians.  Sad commentary on the faith community","I am absolutely for protecting life - I think abortion is the last and worst case situation in most cases. 

That being said: this discussion cannot be black and white. To make abortion a black and white, absolute answer issue is to cause division, ostracise desperate people who need love, and alienate people from Jesus’ teaching which is to love one another and to love God.

Absolutely say you’re against abortion, but if you’re against it, you have to be willing to support the mother who is now forced to live with a child she never really wanted. Support the mother through the pregnancy, after the pregnancy and support the child wholly. 

If we’re against abortion, we have to be better at supporting the women beyond saying it’s ok you’ll love this child one day and we’ll pray for you. That’s what has historically been done by the church, and it’s not good enough. 

As the church, we need to improve our support of mothers throughout their unwanted pregnancy and after. We have to support children’s care homes to look after unwanted kids. We have to consider adoption, or some other means of caring for the unwanted kids that have been brought into the world.

We cannot just say don’t have an abortion and I’ll pray for you.

3,,Christianity,"Hello Fellow Believers!

I am writing this just to say how much I love the Lord. I’m an undergrad student at a Christian college and am taking a class on the New Testament this semester. Every single class I leave crying tears of joy. 
HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD!!!! For covering all our sins in his love. For most of my life I didn’t have a close relationship with God until this year I felt a strong awakening in myself. At the time I was devastated by why I was so depressed and sad, but I realized this sudden conviction was a result of my absent relationship with God, and our innate desire for connection with him. I can not believe that a person like me, sinful every single day, will still be welcomed into the kingdom of Heaven. 

I can not imagine what life would be like without the Grace of God. I don’t even want to imagine that!

&lt;p&gt;I am writing this just to say how much I love the Lord. I’m an undergrad student at a Christian college and am taking a class on the New Testament this semester. Every single class I leave crying tears of joy. 
HOW GREAT IS OUR GOD!!!! For covering all our sins in his love. For most of my life I didn’t have a close relationship with God until this year I felt a strong awakening in myself. At the time I was devastated by why I was so depressed and sad, but I realized this sudden conviction was a result of my absent relationship with God, and our innate desire for connection with him. I can not believe that a person like me, sinful every single day, will still be welcomed into the kingdom of Heaven. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can not imagine what life would be like without the Grace of God. I don’t even want to imagine that!&lt;/p&gt;

6,,Christianity,"Why do animals suffer? 

How can someone be happy in Heaven if their loved ones aren’t there? 

How can seemingly “more loving” religions exist (like zoroastrianism, where everyone eventually gets saved) 

Why is the truth so hidden from us? 

Why do we basically need to be biblical scholars to properly understand the Bible in its context? 

How does God constantly see all the torture, rape, murder, etc. and not do anything? If a person saw all those things they’d become severely depressed

If God loves everyone, how can HE be happy forever knowing many are lost? 

Why didn’t God just create me as an animal so I could go to Heaven? Or just create me as an animal in Heaven? He knows I wouldn’t agree to being human if it meant the possibility of eternal suffering. 

Why doesn’t God only allow those who choose Him to be born? He knows which sperm combined with the right egg will concieve a child who’s brain is just right that they’ll seek God, or analyze information in a way that leads them to Him 

How can people study the same thing and get drastically different views? How can I know who to trust? Can I even trust myself? 

Why does my God-given sense of morality tell me that infinite punishment for finite crime is bad? 

Why did God command for kids to die in the OT? He even had Israelites stab their sword through pregnant ladies bely’s. 

Why does it feel like I may leave Christianity? If it comes to free will, then I want to be with God (assuming He truly does love us) more than anything.  

How is forcing someone to exist without their consent okay if it means the potential for endless suffering? 

Why doesn’t God overrule our free will for our best interest? If Heaven is a place of happiness and joy, and Hell is doom and gloom, God should just force us into heaven; the same way we force someone who attempts suicide to go to the hospital 

Why did the Bible arrive just like every other holy book? It was written by fallible humans who claimed to have been inspired. God could have just sent down the Bible to us pre-written. 

If I was born in a Hindu household and learned about Christianity when I was a teen (just like I learned about Hinduism as a teen when I’ve been a Christian my whole life) I would think it was just as wrong as I think hinduism is now. 

I can’t choose my beliefs. Even though I’m giving Him permission, why won’t God rewire my brain in a way that guarantees I stay a Christian? I want to be locked in forever. 

Why do people of other religions feel their God? Muslims describe bowing to Allah the same way I would describe as worshipping Jesus 

How do we have a relationship with Jesus if He never talks to us? 

Confirmation bias makes it so we’re less likely to change our views on things, so wouldn’t that put people born in the wrong religion at a massive disadvantage compared to those born in the right one? 

Confirmation bias can also make it feel like God is talking to us through Scripture, but people of every religion feel that. When you expect to see something, your brain will be hyper aware for it; like if you consciously think of all the times you see the number 3, you’ll start seeing it everywhere. 

I feel like if I leave Christianity I could end up spending forever in Hell, and that’s what’s kept me in until this point; isn’t this emotional abuse? 

Why not form a type of justice system where once you pay for your crimes, you’re set free? Shouldn’t an all-knowing God know how to do this? 

Why create someone if more than 99.99999999% existence will be spent suffering in Hell? 

Why not give us X amount of time in Heaven, X amount of time in Hell, and then let us decide from there where we wanted to spend eternity? And if it’s because everyone would just choose Heaven- that would be a really good thing. This would make more sense for free will, would it not?

Why does it feel like God doesn’t love us? 

People don’t reject God because they hate love, people clearly love love. So if they got to see God as He truly is, the vast majority of people would choose Him. So why not just reveal Himself that way? Like how SCP-999 literally radiates feelings of love, why won’t God do that for us? How are we supposed to have rejected God if we never personally got to know Him? Non-believers aren’t rejecting God because they don’t know which God even exists, let alone what He’s like. 

The bible says not to worry because God will take care of us, but then He lets children starve to death. If God wanted a child to die, why not make it something instant, like a heart attack? 

How can so many contradictory doctrines exist if the Bible has no contradictions? Some people say that if you don’t repent for every post-salvation sin, you’re doomed to Hell; others say that once you receive salvation it is impossible to get rid of. Both sides have lots of verses support them. 

Due to the fact that I support LGBT rights, am a universalist, etc. most Christians seem to think I’m going to Hell anyway, and most denominations have their own beliefs about salvation (I’ve literally seen comments on /r/TrueChristian that says you can’t be pro-LGBT while also a Christian). 

Why did God slowly have His religion to become more loving? In the OT God had children killed, in the NT God says that children are innocent. And why didn’t God ever ban things we know are wrong, such as pedophilia/child marriage? Or slavery? Een if the Bible doesn’t support modern day slavery, it also never condemns it. It would be as simple as saying “I will not permit a human to own another human”. 

If Adam and Eve weren’t capable of knowing good from evil until they ate from the tree, that means eating from the tree wasn’t evil, and they didn’t know that disobeying was somehow bad. If I told my dog not to eat my food but she did anyways, I wouldn’t hurt her. 

Why does the OT say the sins of the parent would be passed down to their children? 

Why do some NT passages have historical context that we’re told needs to be applied (women being told not to speak in church) but others don’t (divorce, gay marriage, etc.) How can anyone who’s not a historian even know what the “cultural context” was? 

If finding out the truth is so important, why isn’t it an instinct?  

If I were to wake up in Islam’s Hell, I would 100% consider it unjust. You would too, so now just apply that feeling when it comes to non-believers and Christian Hell 

Those who believe in literal hell fire: are you actually okay with the idea your own child/mother/friend/spouse/you could be burned by ACTUAL FIRE for an infinite amount of time? Go to your stove and put your hand over the flame, and now imagine putting your hand in the flame, forever. 

If God is so powerful and knowledgeable, why do 80%+ of souls end up getting lost? 

God wanted to create creatures with free will, but that would lead to many being damned. Wouldn’t God be making a better sacrifice if He just decided to not create beings with free will (and instead made us all animals in paradise), than to die so a select few could be saved? 

Why is it that God won’t show me any type of sign of His existence? I’ve literally asked Him to send me a vision/dream where He hugs me, but nothing. Why would my Heavenly Father not even give me a single hug? 

There are 2500 religions, how are we supposed to know Christianity is true? 

If the historical evidence for Jesus’ resurrection is so strong, then how can scholars spend decades studying and arrive at the conclusion that Jesus may not have even been real? 

Our brains can’t be trusted to form accurate conclusions due to the fact that every brain analyzes information differently, as well as biases that are built in. How can we be faulted by God for having a brain that didn’t work correctly, or skipping over evidence on accident? 

If personal experiences can be proof/evidence for God, then what about personal experiences regarding other religions (past life memories, atheists having an NDE where he saw Heaven, people believing in god/gods after doing DMT, etc.) 

God can reveal Himself to us completely without it taking away from our free will (like He did with the apostle Paul), so why not do that for everyone? It was clearly effective when it came to converting a murderer like Paul. 

I’m tired of trying to make sense of all the morally questionable passages in the Bible(for example Judges 21:10-24 literally says they kidnapped women and forced them to be their wife, and 1 Samuel 15:1-3, where God has them kill children. It’s not possible to justify killing a child).

&lt;p&gt;Why do people of other religions feel their God? Muslims describe bowing to Allah the same way I would describe as worshipping Jesus &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we have a relationship with Jesus if He never talks to us? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirmation bias makes it so we’re less likely to change our views on things, so wouldn’t that put people born in the wrong religion at a massive disadvantage compared to those born in the right one? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Confirmation bias can also make it feel like God is talking to us through Scripture, but people of every religion feel that. When you expect to see something, your brain will be hyper aware for it; like if you consciously think of all the times you see the number 3, you’ll start seeing it everywhere. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like if I leave Christianity I could end up spending forever in Hell, and that’s what’s kept me in until this point; isn’t this emotional abuse? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not form a type of justice system where once you pay for your crimes, you’re set free? Shouldn’t an all-knowing God know how to do this? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why create someone if more than 99.99999999% existence will be spent suffering in Hell? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not give us X amount of time in Heaven, X amount of time in Hell, and then let us decide from there where we wanted to spend eternity? And if it’s because everyone would just choose Heaven- that would be a really good thing. This would make more sense for free will, would it not?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does it feel like God doesn’t love us? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People don’t reject God because they hate love, people clearly love love. So if they got to see God as He truly is, the vast majority of people would choose Him. So why not just reveal Himself that way? Like how SCP-999 literally radiates feelings of love, why won’t God do that for us? How are we supposed to have rejected God if we never personally got to know Him? Non-believers aren’t rejecting God because they don’t know which God even exists, let alone what He’s like. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bible says not to worry because God will take care of us, but then He lets children starve to death. If God wanted a child to die, why not make it something instant, like a heart attack? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can so many contradictory doctrines exist if the Bible has no contradictions? Some people say that if you don’t repent for every post-salvation sin, you’re doomed to Hell; others say that once you receive salvation it is impossible to get rid of. Both sides have lots of verses support them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Due to the fact that I support LGBT rights, am a universalist, etc. most Christians seem to think I’m going to Hell anyway, and most denominations have their own beliefs about salvation (I’ve literally seen comments on &lt;a href=""/r/TrueChristian""&gt;/r/TrueChristian&lt;/a&gt; that says you can’t be pro-LGBT while also a Christian). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did God slowly have His religion to become more loving? In the OT God had children killed, in the NT God says that children are innocent. And why didn’t God ever ban things we know are wrong, such as pedophilia/child marriage? Or slavery? Een if the Bible doesn’t support modern day slavery, it also never condemns it. It would be as simple as saying “I will not permit a human to own another human”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Adam and Eve weren’t capable of knowing good from evil until they ate from the tree, that means eating from the tree wasn’t evil, and they didn’t know that disobeying was somehow bad. If I told my dog not to eat my food but she did anyways, I wouldn’t hurt her. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does the OT say the sins of the parent would be passed down to their children? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why do some NT passages have historical context that we’re told needs to be applied (women being told not to speak in church) but others don’t (divorce, gay marriage, etc.) How can anyone who’s not a historian even know what the “cultural context” was? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If finding out the truth is so important, why isn’t it an instinct?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I were to wake up in Islam’s Hell, I would 100% consider it unjust. You would too, so now just apply that feeling when it comes to non-believers and Christian Hell &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who believe in literal hell fire: are you actually okay with the idea your own child/mother/friend/spouse/you could be burned by ACTUAL FIRE for an infinite amount of time? Go to your stove and put your hand over the flame, and now imagine putting your hand in the flame, forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If God is so powerful and knowledgeable, why do 80%+ of souls end up getting lost? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God wanted to create creatures with free will, but that would lead to many being damned. Wouldn’t God be making a better sacrifice if He just decided to not create beings with free will (and instead made us all animals in paradise), than to die so a select few could be saved? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is it that God won’t show me any type of sign of His existence? I’ve literally asked Him to send me a vision/dream where He hugs me, but nothing. Why would my Heavenly Father not even give me a single hug? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are 2500 religions, how are we supposed to know Christianity is true? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the historical evidence for Jesus’ resurrection is so strong, then how can scholars spend decades studying and arrive at the conclusion that Jesus may not have even been real? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our brains can’t be trusted to form accurate conclusions due to the fact that every brain analyzes information differently, as well as biases that are built in. How can we be faulted by God for having a brain that didn’t work correctly, or skipping over evidence on accident? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If personal experiences can be proof/evidence for God, then what about personal experiences regarding other religions (past life memories, atheists having an NDE where he saw Heaven, people believing in god/gods after doing DMT, etc.) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;God can reveal Himself to us completely without it taking away from our free will (like He did with the apostle Paul), so why not do that for everyone? It was clearly effective when it came to converting a murderer like Paul. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m tired of trying to make sense of all the morally questionable passages in the Bible(for example Judges 21:10-24 literally says they kidnapped women and forced them to be their wife, and 1 Samuel 15:1-3, where God has them kill children. It’s not possible to justify killing a child). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why does asking these questions make me feel like a bad person?&lt;/p&gt;

May I correct you on this one? Eternal torture is not in the Bible. God said: sin leads to death, obedience to eternal life. And eternal life has to be given to us, we don't have it inherently in us:

&gt;Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed— in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. **For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.** So when this corruptible has put on incorruption, and this mortal has put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written: “Death is swallowed up in victory.” “O Death, where is your sting? O Hades, where is your victory?”

&gt;For as you drank on My holy mountain, So shall all the nations drink continually; Yes, they shall drink, and swallow, And they shall be as though they had never been.
Obadiah 1:16 NKJV

They will be destroyed and not exist anymore. Also, the fire they will be thrown into will completely devour them:

The proof is that He died on the cross for you. He left heaven, all the riches,glory,angel praises, and He came down to this little earth of ours. 

He was a man,like you and I, but God at the same time. God became man for you and me, to take our punishment of rebelling against Him!
He had everything but He gave it all for us. Not only did He save us but He gave us the opportunity to share in His inheritance!

There is nothing that can seperate you from His love,you are His precious child and He adores you. There is no end to His love, it is unconditional, everlasting,unearned, unmeasurable.
Let Him comfort you and hold you, He will never let you go no matter what.

&gt;If you didn't accept Jesus Christ, you can become His by being born again. That means you should accept Him as you Lord and Saviour, ask Him for forgiveness of your sins, admit you are a sinner in need of a Saviour.

My advice is to start praying and reading the Bible daily. And as you pray ask God to remove any ungodly thoughts from your mind (Romans 12:2). 
......
Prayer to pray: 
God, I want to put You first in my life. I recognize that this is a daily decision that I must make. But my desire truly is to honor You with my thoughts and actions. So today, I am making this my prayer: “Let the words of my mouth and the thoughts of my heart be pleasing to You, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer.” (Psalms 19:14) In Jesus’ name, Amen.
 

Hope this is helpful. God bless you and guide your mind and heart away from temptation","I'm in the same boat with you. I wish I had the answer. It feels like a spiritual war in my mind. I notice that God tends to confirm his presence to me whenever I read the Bible. I believe that the things of this world are engineered by the devil to tempt us into opposing God. My theory is that when we enjoy what the devil puts in front of us, those kind of thoughts creep in. A lot of the time it is doubt and my mind trying to find ways to disqualify the Bible. It really worries me that I have these thoughts because I know faith is at the core of salvation","It might help to see a mental health professional to discuss these intrusive thoughts. 

On another note, God is all knowing. God knows these are intrusive thoughts. God knows your heart. The bible says God is love, patient, slow to anger, and he doesn't want anyone to perish. 

God isn't looking over your shoulder waiting for you to screw up so he can send you to hell. The fullness of God is revealed in Jesus Christ. Jesus loves everybody, even the folks he disagreed with. Jesus was so loving, he even forgave the folks who were murdering him, before they even asked for forgiveness!

 God is our friend and our father. Have you ever experienced the unconditional love of a father or friend? think of that love x100,000,000,000.",,,,,,

15,,Christianity,"    Yesterday I received the terrible news that my cousin committed suicide. He was the most devoted Christina I have ever met. Read his Bible over 2 hours a day, gave all his money to the poor, spent as much time in church as possible, notebooks filled with knowledge and ideas he picked up from reading the Bible, and even wanted to start his own church. The church that he was involved in was powerful. They casted demons out, healed people, and preached out of the KJV Bible. But the problem I have is that they taught it was possible to lose your salvation if you were not “good enough” or fully 100% dedicating your life to the Lord in every single aspect. In my opinion they manipulated what the word actually says and means to fit there agenda about Christianity. It became apparent to be that they only were preaching about God’s wrath and not Gods love. 

My cousin over time became scared that he was going to lose his salvation, despite being the strongest most dedicated Christian I’ve ever known or seen anywhere. This is because verses like Revelations 3:15-16 and Titus 1:16 and many other versus that refer to not living up to the standard of God/righteousness. 

He had been struggling growing up learning about Jesus love and forgiveness in a Baptist church while also recently learning about Jesus and God in his new church which seems to not claim any branch of Christianity but rather just preaching God’s word as it is exactly written. He had mentioned to me that he had started seeing revelations in the Bible of things that no normal Christin or even devote Christian would have picked up on, noticeably one story which I can’t quote that was an metaphorical example of God’s love. He had mentioned to me that he started hearing voices in his head and he could not discern whether it was the Lord or the Devil speaking to him and sometimes when he listens to the “voices” it’s good and other times it’s evil or nothing comes of it. 

This brings me to this weekend. He went down to have a friend baptized and had mentioned to me and his mother he was scared of losing his salvation. After a long talk with his friend he concluded what his church was teaching was not true, and that God is all loving and forgiving,and the way the Pastor portrayed himself is not biblical. (The pastor at this point has been his number one influence and guide in his life. He looked up to him like a father). He messaged the pastor and told him that he didn’t believe what he was teaching was 100% right and that he needs to teach God’s love in which the pastor said he needs to “read his Bible more” and “pray some more” before he comes to him with these accusations and excommunicated him from the church. I believe this sent him over the edge. He committed suicide a few days later by overdose.

My thoughts on this are very mixed. I understand he was thought God didn’t love him anymore because he was excommunicated from a church he was so devoted to and that might of made him feel this way, but I also think that the voices or demonic entities might have influenced him to take these pills to “stop the voices”. He was never suicidal but I think he was in  so much despair about “betraying God” because the voices told him he did because he was kicked from the church that he felt he didn’t deserve to live anymore. I just don’t understand how such a loyal Christian could have went downhill so fast. I feel like it was a multitude of feelings and emotions all at once mixed with the voices presumably telling him God didn’t love him anymore he unintentionally committed suicide trying to stop the voices. My other theory is that he didn’t want to die one bit, I just believe he was in so much despair about everything all at once he felt he didn’t deserve to live anymore. 

If anyone has any insight or thoughts about this I’d love to hear your responses.

Some people take things too far, and in so doing, they can bring pain on others. Your cousin was so influenced by this, that he was experiencing something called psycheache. That's when someone is suffering so much, other options are blocked out, and they develop a kind of tunnel vision that leads them to believe there's only one way out of their suffering.

20,,Christianity,"“You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things.” Mt 25:23 NIV

 

To succeed in life you need thick skin when it comes to handling criticism. It’s what separates those who say they want success from those who are prepared to pay for it. For example, if you’ve been praying for a mate to share your life, ask yourself if you’re prepared for the sacrifice and responsibility that comes with marriage. Are you stable? Are you unselfish? Are you mature enough to provide for a family? Or if you’re asking God to increase your business, are you providing outstanding service to your existing clients? Someone quipped: “A peacock that rests on its feathers is just another turkey!” Sometimes we’re in love with the image of success, but we haven’t counted the actual cost of succeeding. It’s a good thing God doesn’t automatically give us everything we ask for. Often we want something because it looks good in someone else’s life. But God in His wisdom knows that right now it would hurt us because we’re not mature enough to handle it. God tests us with what we have, in order to develop our consistency and strength. He observes how we handle the pressures that accompany the blessings He’s already given us. He wants to bring us to the place where we’re impervious to adversity; where we’ve learned to appreciate the Giver more than His gifts. When we reach that point, we’ll hear Him say, “You have been faithful with a few things; I will put you in charge of many things. Come and share your master’s happiness!” (v. 23 NIV).

Remember in Job, Satan needed God's permission to even come into his presence. Satan's job in salvation is to humble and humiliate sinners so they will realize their lowliness and come to repentance. That's why Paul says to deliver the unrepentant sinner to Satan for the destruction of their body, that they might come to repentance.","He has enough grace for us, don't you think he's giving Satan time to choose also ?

23,,Christianity,"I'll just start off by saying I was raised to be a strong Christian. My mother and much of my extended family are strong Christians so I just always accepted it as the way. I'm 35 now. 

Two years ago my mother became very ill to the point where she almost starved to death. Through this she grew even stronger in her faith and so did I, because we were so devastated by the prospect of her death that we were looking to heaven as the only hope, and the our family was very supportive. I was living on my own for a decade but I moved back in with her to care for her. 

Soon after starting to recover physically, she started deteriorating mentally. She started having awful night terrors and uncontrollable thoughts to the point where she was convinced she was demon possessed. She would hear horrible things at night and imagine demonic faces looking at her. She started becoming afraid of going out in public. She started to hate staying still because her thoughts were going crazy with fear, so she would literally drive around in her car all day. It was a literal nightmare. I would wake up to her screams and run downstairs trying to comfort her and become so upset that I would get physically ill. She was the healthiest, happiest, kindest person I ever knew and my best friend and role model, and within the course of the year she has become a terrified and tortured shell of herself before my eyes. 

Soon enough she started talking about her fears that she committed sins too great to be forgiven, and that God had handed her over to Satan, and was torturing her until she would eventually die and go to hell. had Our family who was previously so supportive wasn't of much help. They told her that the reason she was suffering mentally was because she had sin in her heart that she hadn't repented for, and that if she repented she would gain some peace back again. She begged God night and day to help her and accept her repentance but she continued to deteriorate. She would leave long, obsessive notes about how she would burn in hell amd she is the worst sinner in the world. She became fixated on the often misinterpreted verse Hebrews 10:26, that if we continue sinning having the knowledge of God there is no forgiveness. We argued about this verse daily. We had her talk to pastors, we had her talk to a Christian counselor, we had her talk to a Christian radio host from another state. The fear in her mind was so great and overwhelming that she was completely incapable of seeing it another way. 

Eventually we got her in to a psychiatrist for help, which took over 5 months to get into. He has put her on several rounds of several different antidepressants and anti psychotics. The body of Christians we used to have Bible study wirh for decades (also our family) condemned us and said that any mind altering medication is witchcraft, and can send her to hell. She has improved a bit, but nowhere near enough to have anything resembling a normal life. She still speaks to almost no one, still is in extreme fear every minute of every day, still hasn't seen family in over a year, amd doesn't do anything besides drive around or lay in her bed. She can't stand to do something as simple as watch TV because she sees people living normal lives and it's too painful for her. Worst of all she still believes without any doubt that she will burn in hell for eternity. The people we always listened to continue to tell that she will burn in hell if she doesn't accept God's forgiveness.

This gets to my struggle with God. I grew up with the understanding that God gives people a semblance of comfort and forgiveness. Yes, I understand that nightmarish things happen to good people in this world, and that life isn't fair. When she was almost dying I didn't question him since I understood this.

I want to believe her and I can meet in heaven and be happy again more than anything. But every day of suffering that goes by I get more and more hopeless.

A man named Horatio Spafford lost is son in a chicago fire. This hymn was written after traumatic events in Spafford's life. The first two were the death of his four-year-old son and the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, which ruined him financially (he had been a successful lawyer and had invested significantly in property in the area of Chicago that was extensively damaged by the great fire). His business interests were further hit by the economic downturn of 1873, at which time he had planned to travel to Europe with his family on the SS Ville du Havre. In a late change of plan, he sent the family ahead while he was delayed on business concerning zoning problems following the Great Chicago Fire. **While crossing the Atlantic Ocean, the ship sank rapidly after a collision with a sea vessel, the Loch Earn, and all four of Spafford's daughters died.** His wife Anna survived and sent him the now famous telegram, ""Saved alone …"". Shortly afterwards, as Spafford traveled to meet his grieving wife, he was inspired to write these words as his ship passed near where his daughters had died.

For to me, to live is Christ and to die is gain. Philippians 1:20-21

Just as it is written,
“For Your sake we are being put to death all day long;
We were considered as sheep to be slaughtered.” But in all these things we overwhelmingly conquer through Him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Romans 8:36-39
who by faith conquered kingdoms, performed acts of righteousness, obtained promises, shut the mouths of lions, quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, from weakness were made strong, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight. Women received back their dead by resurrection; and others were tortured, not accepting their release, so that they might obtain a better resurrection; and others experienced mockings and scourgings, yes, also chains and imprisonment. They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were tempted, they were put to death with the sword; they went about in sheepskins, in goatskins, being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated (men of whom the world was not worthy), wandering in deserts and mountains and caves and holes in the ground. And all these, having gained approval through their faith, did not receive what was promised, because God had provided something better for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect. Hebrews 11:33-40

Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. We have come to know and have believed the love which God has for us. God is love, and the one who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. By this, love is perfected with us, so that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because as He is, so also are we in this world. There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment, and the one who fears is not perfected in love. We love, because He first loved us. If someone says, “I love God,” and hates his brother, he is a liar; for the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from Him, that the one who loves God should love his brother also. 1 John 4:15-21

And He has said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.” Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me. Therefore I am well content with weaknesses, with insults, with distresses, with persecutions, with difficulties, for Christ’s sake; for when I am weak, then I am strong. 2 Corinthians 12:9-10",,,,,,,

The one doing the condemnation is the person themselves; for not choosing to take of the gift offered. Notice Christ says the Father gave Him all right to judge, but even so, He says He will not judge anyone(in that context).

Ultimately, our choice to accept or forego the gift, affects our salvation; and that is what makes the difference.

What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,” and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that? Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself. But someone may well say, “You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.” You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder. But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” and he was called the friend of God. You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead. James 2:14-26

The only thing that you can control is how you react to adversity and challenges in life.,"There are Christian spiritual disciplines that will help foster the interior life with God, rather than merely reading the Bible (which is always to be done, but it's like reading the book on how to drive, but not stepping into the car to learn the application of the theory).

Things like Lectio Divina (Holy reading) - here you follow a 4 step process when reading God's word:
1. Lectio - slowly read the passage (recommend one from the gospels to start off with). Read it again even slower, like a love letter from God to You. Savour each word and ask God to speak to you. Read again even slower as you listen for something to speak from the text. 

2. Meditatio - Once you've got that bit that speaks to you, move to the next stage and mediate on that phrase. Why does it speak to you? What does it mean to you? Chew it over in your heart and mind. What could it mean for you?

3. Oratio - now bring that meditation to God and ask for help about the thing you've mediated upon. Listen to what God might bring to mind for you as an answer. 

4. Contemplatio- relax in the velvety darkness / light of God's presence. Let God's spirit mode through you to change your life from within. 

... try this technique with the Luke 5:1-11 passage of Jesus calling the first disciples. 



Another technique is Ignatian Meditation, where you read a Bible passage, usually again a gospel passage, like John 2, the Cana Wedding. You immerse yourself into the passage scene, looking around as you read the text (make sure you're familiar with your text). What do you smell, see, hear, taste, touch as the story unfolds? At the end, there's an encounter with Jesus, where you can ask him a question, wait for his response, then listen to his question to you, and wait as you formulate a response. 

The first time I was shown this, it was the Cana passage, and my question to Jesus was fairly crass ""How did you do that?"", his response: ""The elements bend to my will"". His question to me was: ""Will you bend to my will?"" - powerful stuff which helps shape my life. 

More info here: https://www.soulshepherding.org/ignatian-meditation-guides/

You can find Ignatian meditations on YouTube. 


The final spiritual discipline is the hardest: Silence. Practice ten minutes a day of intentional silence of the voice, mind and heart, lighting a candle as you enter God's Holy presence intentionally. You just be still and know God. That's it. But it's hard to still the mind chatter... That takes practice, but there are plenty of resources out there to help practice the presence of God in silence. 


The trouble today with modern Christianity is that it's all about doing, rather than being. ""Look busy, Jesus is coming!"" Loud music to overwhelm the senses into a human controlled situation that can be manipulative by the ""worship leaders"". 

Be warned, once you start training yourself using Christian spiritual disciplines, your walk with Jesus will not be the same.",,,,,,

I'm going to answer your questions with that assumption in mind.

&gt;why couldn't god have gave us freewill and made the world perfect at the same time? is this too much for an omnipotent being?

Libertarian free will is the idea that your choices are not determined. God cannot determine that free creatures always do what is right because that's a contradiction. He'd have to determine a choice that is not determined. Omnipotence doesn't mean you can engage in logical incoherence. An undetermined choice that is determined is a logical incoherence.

&gt;and no we wouldn't be ""robots"" because god is perfectly capable of making anything correct? he COULD make a perfect world giving us freewill and individuality but for some odd reason didn't. also, in a sense we are already robots since god knows everything we're going to do right?

If by ""anything,"" you're including logically contradictory things, no, God can't make anything. He can't make a married bachelor or a cubical sphere. In the same way, God can't make a creature with libertarian free will whose choices are all determined. And no, God knowing everything we're going to do does not make us robots. Robots do not act out of volition, but we do, whether God knows what we're going to do or not.

&gt;and no, this world was never perfect. if it was perfect it wouldn't have changed for the worse. if whatever god created was perfect and sin somehow got in the mix then doesn't that mean when we die into eternal perfection it could happen again?

There are a few possibilities. One possibility is that sin *could* enter the world again, but it just *happens* that it never will. Another possibility is that God removes libertarian free will in the future. Another possibility is that people *will* sin again.

That third one can be ruled out on the basis of Scripture since it says that after God rights all wrongs, everything will be hunky dory. There won't be anymore sin.","How many? Like how many pastors have you asked?

42,,Christianity,"Hi,

Last week I was hit by a car when biking home from a friends house, 

I was super lucky and only suffered from a sprained foot after getting wheeled away in an ambulance.

Last night, I got a sudden urge to start to become more religious when watching TV in bed. I downloaded the Bible App on my iPad and wanted to start reading it again. 

Context: I am religious in a sense, I pray every night and sometimes go to church with my family but I'm scared I only pray because of habit or when I want something. 

So today, I have started to be able to walk (haven't been able to walk since the car crash) and went to go get a coffee with my sister. I was walking back home alone and got stopped by a man.

He asked what happened to me and then proceeded to ask if he could pray for me. I was a little shocked but said: ""Yes please"". He then got down on his knees and covered my ankle (where the sprain was) and started praying on the side of the street. After around a minute he got up and asked if the pain was gone. To my surprise, I couldn't feel the pain anymore. He then wished me luck and left.

I was able to walk home without discomfort (which I was feeling prior to the encounter).

I don't know if I am imagining that the pain was gone but it was definitely opened my eyes up to becoming more religious again. I get (good) chills when I think of what happened. 

Let me know your thoughts on what might've happened or any advice,

&gt; I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory about to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the children of God; for the creation was subjected to futility, not of its own will but by the will of the one who subjected it, in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay and will obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God. We know that the whole creation has been groaning in labour pains until now; and not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the first fruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly while we wait for adoption, the redemption of our bodies. For in hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what is seen? But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.

&gt; Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness; for we do not know how to pray as we ought, but that very Spirit intercedes with sighs too deep for words. And God, who searches the heart, knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.

Or Isaiah 55: 

&gt; Ho, everyone who thirsts,
   come to the waters;
and you that have no money,
   come, buy and eat!
Come, buy wine and milk
   without money and without price.
Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread,
   and your labour for that which does not satisfy?
Listen carefully to me, and eat what is good,
   and delight yourselves in rich food.
Incline your ear, and come to me;
   listen, so that you may live.
I will make with you an everlasting covenant,
   my steadfast, sure love for David.
See, I made him a witness to the peoples,
   a leader and commander for the peoples.
See, you shall call nations that you do not know,
   and nations that do not know you shall run to you,
because of the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel,
   for he has glorified you.


&gt; Seek the Lord while he may be found,
   call upon him while he is near;
let the wicked forsake their way,
   and the unrighteous their thoughts;
let them return to the Lord, that he may have mercy on them,
   and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.
For my thoughts are not your thoughts,
   nor are your ways my ways, says the Lord.
For as the heavens are higher than the earth,
   so are my ways higher than your ways
   and my thoughts than your thoughts.


&gt; For as the rain and the snow come down from heaven,
   and do not return there until they have watered the earth,
making it bring forth and sprout,
   giving seed to the sower and bread to the eater,
so shall my word be that goes out from my mouth;
   it shall not return to me empty,
but it shall accomplish that which I purpose,
   and succeed in the thing for which I sent it.


&gt; For you shall go out in joy,
   and be led back in peace;
the mountains and the hills before you
   shall burst into song,
   and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.
Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress;
   instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle;
and it shall be to the Lord for a memorial,
   for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.","33 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the wilderness

1. The one thing you can know beyond a shadow of a doubt is that God loves your friend. Period. We cannot know anyone's eternal disposition. You can't know if the last words that ran through your friend's mind were ""Jesus, remember me..."" So there's always hope.

2. Dallas Willard said this about hell:
""Thus no one chooses to go to hell or to be the kind of person who belongs there, but his orientation toward himself leads him to become the kind of person for whom away-from-God is the only place for which he is suited.  He would choose that place for himself rather than humble himself before God and accept who God is. We should seriously inquire if to live in a world permeated with God and the knowledge of God is something we truly desire.  If not, we can be assured that God will excuse us from his presence.""

*If* your friend is ultimately excused from God's presence, that's the best available option for your friend. Living in a world permeated by God's presence would be torturous for someone who hates God. Put another way, as C.S. Lewis said, ""The gates of hell are locked from the inside."" If we say anything more about hell than that it is ""away-from-God"" for those who refuse to be in God's presence, I think we're pressing scriptural metaphors (e.g., darkness and fire at the same time...

But I also think the synoptic gospels believe Jesus is the incarnation of Israel's God too. It's just not as explicit because it's presupposed for the authors. That's part of what bothers modern readers is that they are looking for the gospel writers to make an argument that Jesus is actually divine to a modern skeptical audience, but that's just not what the authors are interested in doing. This leads to problems as even many Christians come to the text with a very modern idea of what the word ""God"" means and then try to fit Jesus into that mold. But it's important to remember that the Christian claim doesn't start with the modern deistic definition of God. The claim is that Jesus of Nazareth was and is the *incarnation of Israel's god*. And once we look at the gospels through that lens, we start to see what the authors think about it.

In the synoptics, Jesus' repeatedly refers to himself as Son of Man. This doesn't tell us much in itself, except that the final reference to it is during his trial before the high priest (Mark 14) in which Jesus directly references to Daniel 7 in which ""one like a Son of Man"" shares the throne of the Ancient of Days. That scene is a development of Ezekiel 1 (which describes a divine throne-chariot in which God sits) and Ezekiel 8:2 (which develops ch. 1 and suggests a human manifestation of the figure on the throne-chariot in Ch. 1). Thus, it seems that Jesus is saying that he is the one for whom it is appropriate to be on par with God.

Jesus' own self-understanding in the synoptic tradition must also be understood in light of the Jewish belief that, at the time of the Babylonian exile, God had abandoned the temple and his people (Ezekiel 1) but would later return. Even though the geographical return from exile had occurred by the time of Jesus, there was still a sense that God had not yet returned to Zion. The second temple was built, but the divine glory had not come to dwell there (as it had in first temple in 1 Kings 8). Hence, Malachi says ""the Lord whom you seek *will* suddenly come to his temple."" No one (with the possible exception of the Essenes) says that God had actually come back yet.

With this background in mind, look at the stories that Jesus tells. The synoptics all record Jesus telling parables about a king or land owner who goes away and comes back again (e.g. the Parable of the Talents or Pounds in Luke 19 and Matthew 25) to explain what he himself was doing. These stories were bound to be understood by his Jewish audience as stories about God and Israel. So when people asked Jesus about his actions, and he explained them by talking about God coming back. Therefore, he seems to have thought that his journey to Jerusalem was the return of Yahweh to Zion.

So the synoptics don't have the same kind of statements about Jesus and God than John has (though the way in which some Christians have used even those as prooftexts is problematic). Rather, they indicate by their wider structure and content that the character of Jesus is grasped by a vocation to do and be things that, according to the Hebrew scriptures, only God can do and be.",,,,,,

The answer is not to just give up and ""do whatever,"" it's to confess your sins to God and trust that Christ's work on the cross is sufficient to cover over your sins - because it is. You're a sinner. I'm a sinner. Everyone here is a sinner. It's a big club, and our only hope is Christ, who bore your sins and your shame on the cross and rose again.

A couple of resources that I usually recommend are the book ""Shameless"" by Nadia Bolz Weber and ""Beyond Shame - Creating a Healthy Sex Life on your Own Terms"" by Matthias Roberts.

Can God change reality, for example 1+1 is for sure 2,but can God change that fact? Does reality really exist? Reality we all know about is not reality if it can be changed, everything can be reality if God make it to be, and then ""everything"" has no rules.

What does ""nothing"" means? When you thing about nothing you imagine endless black, but black is just colour and endless is just something without end. Can you imagine nothing? God once had to be in ""one"" nothing to create something, but there was no time or space, no rules of reality.

1.
Can God change reality, for example 1+1 is for sure 2,but can God change that fact? Does reality really exist? Reality we all know about is not reality if it can be changed, everything can be reality if God make it to be, and then &amp;quot;everything&amp;quot; has no rules.
2. 
What does &amp;quot;nothing&amp;quot; means? When you thing about nothing you imagine endless black, but black is just colour and endless is just something without end. Can you imagine nothing? God once had to be in &amp;quot;one&amp;quot; nothing to create something, but there was no time or space, no rules of reality.

1. Our reality is subjective, what you believe reality is could / is, is different then what I may believe. Of course there are obvious human constructs we all just grow up to agree because communication would be very difficult if we didn’t, like 1+1 are numbers made by humans in order to communicate math efficiently. We don’t know all of God’s rules, I hope you’ll be able to ask one day, and let me know. :) 


2. This one has always perplexed me. I don’t believe “nothing” is achievable in my current state of knowledge, in the physical world, there’s literally always something. But yes if I had to describe nothing, I would say it would be your consciousness / awareness stagnate in a black area with zero sound emitting from any direction

3. God can do anything, technically. But he is perfect so I personally like to believe that thought wouldn’t cross his mind.

Probably didn’t help much but that’s my take. As you’re aware, one of the highest archetypes from the Bible is to have faith. Faith that all of these questions are just your mind playing tricks on you. These aren’t things to be worried about imo. 🙂","Don't live chained to the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. 

Life is short. Spend it serving God instead of trying to explain him to yourself.

I relinquished my demand to understand.   What a relief!","No God can not break his own rules

When and if he breaks his own rules, reality will cease to exist. Such is the perfection of the reality he has created. If he were to touch the parameters the system will destabilize and collapse.

Nothingness is a state in which there is nothing. Darkness is the state where there are no photons or energy. Nothingness is a state of total darkness and lack of energy, even heat.

Also, there are so many of these motivational, videos online that are montages of famous speakers giving pep talks. I also see a lot of these same speakers promoting ""affirmations"". Positive, often secular, statements to help people self motivate themselves. Similar to the above reference to meditation, can Christians use Christ-based, Biblically-based affirmations to enrich their walk with Christ and to live out more fully His will for our lives?

This is a Christian affirmation montage that has Bible verses as the affirmation. What is your take on these types of things?",,,,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxc1KIkqYG4,

When the Bible speaks against things like sorcery, you need to consider the original context.  It's a very old book, and the meaning of what sorcery was back then may be different than a lot of what we think of related to the term today.

One way to get at the meaning of the word is to consider its etymology (historical meaning and evolution of the term), or turn to early texts that talk about it (extra-biblical tradition and teaching).  To do this, an interlinear bible is useful (like the one here: [https://biblehub.com/interlinear/](https://biblehub.com/interlinear/)), because it links to the original Hebrew and Greek words, and then quickly links again to definitions to get context.  In some cases, additional commentary can help shed light on the subject if there is confusion.

In the case of one of the words translated as sorcery in particular, [https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=g5331](https://www.blueletterbible.org/lang/lexicon/lexicon.cfm?t=kjv&amp;strongs=g5331), we see that it is tied to drug use, poisoning, and/or idolatry.  This would not be prescription drugs for the betterment of a person, but is very similar to what is said to be practiced by bokors - to poison someone to make them weak, to diminish their natural capacity in any way, or to intimidate or control a population.  In extreme cases, this includes poisoning to kill.  Other commentators have linked it to psychoactive drugs to attain visions or seek a connection to the divine.

There are, of course, other root words connected to sorcery or witchcraft which are related a bit to what we might consider traditional witchcraft, incantations and the like.  Of course, seeking spiritualists and contact with the dead is forbidden as well, if you take that seriously.

A 'magic' **show** that involves illusions and even misdirection is generally not something that even the performers suggest is real, though.  To me, it's very clearly just an entertainment thing that is not connected with the original intended application of the term.  Now, if they were trying to use this to deceive others as a charlatan and not being honest about it, then that would probably still be condemned - even if not directly by the term then indirectly by working ill of one's neighbor.",As long as it's not real magic it's fine; best avoid Vegas just to be safe.,"Illusionists usually acknowledge that what they do is simple tricks of the eye. So yes, it's ok.",,,,,,

So. In the month or so between that post and this one, its been confirmed that my mom has early stage cirrhosis. We have an appointment with a leading hepatologist on the 26th in Chicago for what we have to do going forward. The doctors say my mom isn't in any danger of dying but will most likely need a liver transplant in the future.

My dad had to go back to work, and he works mostly out of state so I'm now the only one keeping an eye on her. But this coming Sunday we will have a nurse coming by regularly to help out.

My mom has gotten so weak. She shakes when she moves, she's got painful edema in her legs now and shes tired all the time and has lost a large amount of weight. She gets confused easily and it scares me.

This time last year, all was well. She was healthy and we were all fine. It tortures me to see her like this. 

I'm making sure she gets all her meds, she gets her food, and I try to keep her warm and comfortable. I take her to all her Dr's appointments and I'm up half the night every night helping her to get to the restroom and then back in bed.

My mental and emotional health is in rapid decline as I'm being strong for her and my Dad so they can trust me. I'm having trouble sleeping because part of my brain is always listening down the hall to see if she needs help. 

I find myself breaking down in tears while I'm cooking or cleaning just because I'm largely alone in this until my dad gets back mid to end of May.

I just want this all to stop. I want my mom back. 

I pray until I can't think of anything to say and until I have a headache from crying so much.

And of course, my insurance won't cover a therapist, and I'm unemployed so I can't pay out of pocket for one either.

I don't feel joy or happiness anymore. I don't get satisfaction out of my hobbies or talking with my friends online. I feel isolated and under constant attack or pressure or pain from nearly every aspect of my life.

I took care of my wife at home for nearly four years after the doctors said she had two weeks to live at best.  Yes it was a struggle.  Yes I sometimes broke down in tears.  Yes I took early Social Security at a greatly reduced amount which now is the maximum I ever will receive.  Yes I still am struggling with depression on a daily basis over a year after she passed.  I know we also formed a far deeper bond during those years than we ever had earlier (we were married for thirty-five year).  I learned more about what it means to love as God loves than at any other time in my life.  Jesus suffered tremendous pain and humiliation in His death so I can live.  There were times it was so emotionally painful I could not swallow my food past the lump in my throat, but sometimes we must lay our own lives down for those God has placed in our lives to care for.  It never is easy to lay down our lives.  It was not easy for Christ to die on the Cross.  I daily take great comfort from Paul's words that these ""momentary light afflictions"" are not worthy to be compared with the glory that will be revealed in us.  Participating in the fellowship of His suffering is far from fun, but we know it will yield tremendous rewards.  So, yes.

He is God. Check the trinity

He is on Heaven at the Right of The Father.

Nothing. The timd of Him returning is not here yet.

&gt;. I know this is a bit unrelated do angels have the power to show themselves whenever they wish and if they can why don’t they?

They only act upon God command as messengers"," 

Hello, friend, how are you? I'll try to answer your questions, and I hope I can help! 1. First of all, I think it would be helpful to try to explain the Trinity, the standard christian theology (or orthodox theology) believes that God is one, coexisting in three persons (The Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit), and that Jesus Christ has two natures (The divine nature and the human nature), and when he was on earth he was limited by his human nature (Which means he made himself small to be between us, having human struggles like hunger, tiredness and temptation). Taking this basic informations as a base, yes, Jesus could talk with the Father as a human, which means he wasn't talking to himself (As God the Son), but talking to God the Father. Take for example the passage of **Luke 23:34** \-

*Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.""*

You see? Jesus is talking to God, the Father; 2. As a human, Jesus had the presence of the Holy Spirit (Which is The Spirit of God), who guided Jesus in his time on earth. It is quite evident the care of the Father for his Son principally during the childhood of Jesus, protecting him and his family, let's see the passage of **Mathew 2:13-15** \-

*When they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. “Get up,” he said, “take the child and his mother and escape to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, for Herod is going to search for the child to kill him.”* *So he got up, took the child and his mother during the night and left for Egypt, where he stayed until the death of Herod. And so was fulfilled what the Lord had said through the prophet: “Out of Egypt I called my son.”*

3. I recommend you to read **Luke 24** and **Acts 1** to have more context, but Jesus returned to the Heavens, where he no longer is limited by his human nature, and sits by the right hand of the Father (Read **Acts 7:54-59**). (I'm sorry to be more vague in this answer);

4. Let's start with **John 3:16** \- *For God so loved the world that he gave his one and only Son, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have eternal life.* This passage is important, because we first need to understand that God's intention for all people is that we are all saved, by Christ, and it is that simple, we just need to repent from our sins and trust in Jesus as our Savior the earn eternal life, remember that, it will be important. Jesus actually tells us what need to happen before he comes back, both in the gospels and in Revelations, so lets read Mathew 24:14 -

*And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.* As you can see, the end will come (AKA Jesus second coming) only when all nations hear the gospel, so every person has the opportunity to be saved. Jesus hasn't come back yet because this and a few other things are yet to be fulfilled. (It highly recommend you to read the full chapter of **Mathew 24**, it really explains a lot of things about the second coming)

5. Well, the word angel in hebraic is **מַלְאָךְ** (malach), which means messenger, and a messenger is always subordinate to his Lord (God), so they will only appear by the command of God (read , and yes, they have free will as well, that's why Satan and the demons exist, they're all angels that freely chose to abandon God.

It is important to understand that humans and angels don't live in the same real (or dimension), so the only way that humans can interact with the spirits, angels in this case, is if God, by the Holy Spirit, open our spiritual eyes, just like what happens in **2 Kings 6:15-17**

*When the servant of the man of God got up and went out early the next morning, an army with horses and chariots had surrounded the city. “Oh no, my lord! What shall we do?” the servant asked.* *“Don’t be afraid,” the prophet answered. “Those who are with us are more than those who are with them.” And Elisha prayed, “Open his eyes, Lord, so that he may see.” Then the Lord opened the servant’s eyes, and he looked and saw the hills full of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.*

Well, I hope I have helped, God bless you for your curiosity, keep your will to make questions, that's the best way to learn!","&gt;1. Could he talk with god with his time on earth?
2. Did god watch over him in his time on earth?
3. What happened to him after his death on the cross and ascension to heaven?

Jesus Christ is God's earthly experience. 

&gt;4. What is stopping him from returning to earth if he so wished?

The problem is, I work manual labor/retail/warehouse jobs and get bored because it is often mindless work which often seems trivial to me.

I am currently unemployed during this COVID scare and don't know where to go from here. I am living with some people who have connections in this area and they sound like they are interested in helping, but so far it has not been FT work ideas where I can get benefits for insurance coverage. Also, there aren't really any good churches around here. I would like to move somewhere within the state where I could be near a decent church. 

Some thoughts: 

1. go back to school for a masters in Counseling- not sure how I would afford that or even convinced there is much opportunity to do that in a paid ministry setting. I thought about Chaplaincy, but I don't have years of experience as a pastor. 
2. Get some other kind of degree/certification/training that can be useful for actually earning money.
3. Try to start a handyman business- but I really need a job with insurance benefits (I have a medical issue- but that issue doesn't limit my work ability)
4. Just take the next random hourly wage job I can get an offer on that pays a minimum survivable wage and just commit to that for the rest of my life.

And this, in fact, is our take-home lesson from Job.",There’s no answer. It’s a mystery. For thousands of years “Why does God let bad things happen to good people” is asked. In the book it makes it clear that Job doesn’t deserve it but still gets everything taken. In the end though he is blessed. God always acts in our interest even if we can’t see it or it doesn’t make sense.,"As Job and his friends debate God’s fairness, it becomes apparent that all of them basically believe in the doctrine of “retribution theology”—every act receives just punishment or reward in this present life, so we should be able to tell who is righteous or wicked by whether they are visibly blessed or cursed on earth. This is a false doctrine, but Job thought it should be true and went on the offensive, charging God with injustice and calling for a trial (Job 29–31). Surprisingly, God condescends and agrees to be put on trial. The speeches in Job 38–41 actually consist of God’s testimony in His own defense. In the “trial” we see that Job has no legal standing to convict God. Job cannot demonstrate how God runs the universe, so he cannot present any evidence of injustice (chapters 38–39). Also, God establishes His absolute right to act as He sees fit. As proof, He points to two creatures—behemoth and leviathan—that mankind has no control over whatsoever and that answer only to God.",,,,,,

I a senior at a Christian high school, and most of my friends are from there. But most of my friends have shaky faith at best.

One of my friends has been depressed and very stressed for several months. And she’s frequently mentioned killing herself at specific places at several points, but never ended up following through. They don’t sound like jokes anymore. She experienced some drama recently where she was mad with her friend for telling her mom that he thought something was wrong, and I tried to talk to her about it.

Two weeks ago, I had the most demonic feeling dream I’ve ever had, and it involved the sculpture the Pietà. Two days ago I found a miniature version of it on display at a family member’s house, and it freaked me out. I talked to my favorite teacher at my school about it. He said that recently, he had prayed that god would make Christianity more real for me, and that the dream could be used by god to bring me closer to him.

And now, three of my friends have said that they feel like something is off with my friend that is likely suicidal. They said they’ve also had dreams of sown thing happening to her, and that the whole situation just feels wrong and off.

I honestly think that demonic influence may be present, and my dream may have been gods way of alerting me to the situation to help. My other friends are going to talk to the same teacher I talked to about it, and I think maybe I should ask if he could talk to her parents?

I had to leave them all behind me, because everytime I would try and hang with them, I would always be led into back into my sin. So the majority are gone now. No bad feelings, just didn't work out. 

I did have one old drinking buddy, (my cousin) that followed along and is submitting to God as I did and me and him have restructured our relationship from drugs and alcohol to biblical talk and playing Madden lol. 

I hope that something like that may happen for you, but most of all I hope you put your relationship with God above any friend you ever make on this Earth. Let your faith and love for Jesus grow and he will guide you.

Then sometime on the day you've signed up for, you post the Bible passage and any ideas, questions, insights, meditations ... that you have.

In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, ... 19 And there was evening, and there was morning—the fourth day.

I think I should confess... 

One of the underlying things underneath my porn addiction is a need for male affection that has become sexualized. I know this is different than being gay or bi particularly. It feels different, but yes, it is partially sexualized. I so deeply want to know that I am man enough and have what it takes to face the world with strength as a man. I actually think men are beautiful, and we don’t hear that enough from one another. I have trust issues too, and am a guarded personality. I just want another bro to hold me close. Not in a romance way, but in an understanding and seen brotherly sort of way. Affection.

I’ve never told anyone that before. But, I find myself masturbating to other men, not out of attraction to be with them, but out of envy and a desire to have what I perceive they have as part of myself. This is distracting, because I want to get over this to be with an awesome girl. But, it’s baggage and insecurity I am ashamed of to the core.

I need to learn how to have buddies again and be in real sharpening friendship with other guys.

We're taught Biblical infallibility and literal/surface interpretation only, and then kicked out into the world where the evidence is that a lot of it simply could not have happened as written. My favorite is that Old Testament battle in 2 Chronicles where half a million Israelite men died in combat- a number that if true nearly surpasses the number of men who perished on battlefields in the entire US Civil War. It's not impossible, but it certainly pushes the absolute limits of believability. 

Most of all, I'm really just writing to encourage you to keep searching. The questions you pose are worth wrestling with continually, and not just until you've reached a conclusion in either X or Y direction. I think one of the most unfortunate trends in (modern, Western) Christianity is the idea that at some point you just need to shut off your brain and believe, usually backed with circular scriptural references that say I need to believe scripture because it is scripture. On the other end I reject the idea of ""apostasy"" or that there's some magic line you cross and you're no longer a Christian, and again you can just shut off your brain because you've decided you don't believe. I think we're all at different points in our faith journeys and to dichotomize such a complex process into needing to come to an ""either A, or B"" conclusion cheapens the whole deal. 

So finally to your question in bold- what would you consider evidence in the affirmative? You are not going to find first-hand accounts of anyone in history that wasn't a leader of a nation and subject to formal histories. This is largely true until very modern times. He was after all, merely the son of day laborer in a remote Roman province, who after three years of intense ministry was executed by local officials. That's not to say there isn't somewhat contemporary evidence of his existence- you likely know of his mentions by Tacitus, Josephus, and the Mishnah. It's remarkable really that we have any historical evidence of Jesus. However, if your faith hinges on a standard of evidence that can't be met by the vast majority of human existence, to say less of someone with as humble roots as Jesus, I think you will come away unsatisfied.  

That is not to say that there is no basis for belief. I find it useful to reflect on this central tension in the Bible- our expectations for God, versus what He actually is. The disciples and most of his Jewish followers  clearly expected him to be a military and political ruler, and throw off the chains of Roman oppression. We, from our modern perspective, expect that anyone so significant would surely leave behind a historical wake, similar to what we would see from say, a Julius Caesar (and disregarding that the vast majority of what we say we know about Caesar is only from his own writings, and themselves lack primary evidence). However we know from Jesus's own words that earthly glory and renown was never his intention- he came as a sacrifice, and to point however briefly to the Lord- nothing more. You can find this tension satisfying or unsatisfying- I suppose it would be nice to have a God that writes daily reminders to us in the clouds that he exists. However, I would also note that this is exactly what happened in Exodus, and they were worshipping the Golden Calf a few nights later. However, just as most things in life are not as simple and straightforward, I have come to accept also that my faith in Jesus will never be as straightforward as I want it to be, and to find satisfaction in this tension between knowing and not knowing.

I guess the last thing I would leave you with is that if you are near an institution of higher learning that offers history degrees or has a divinity school, you will find people much, much smarter than me that can talk on these subjects with authority, rather than the hurried ramblings of someone who's late for work. 

Good luck on your search.",What have you read about the historicity of Jesus so far?," The best book I feel I can direct you to is Lee Strobel's The Case for Christ but I have a feeling you've probably already found that and the book only goes over the bare minimum of evidence, sparse as it is, anyway.

I swear if I make a statement that doesn’t perfectly align with the conservative/religious point of view, I’ll be challenged and asked for a source. Upon providing a source, they’ll question its integrity, and present me with a different source that validates their mindset. From there, I could come up with 15 different counterpoints that they can’t refute but will still be met with skepticism. 

However, they have no issue accepting the Bible as legitimate, substantiated text. We’re talking about a book that was written thousands of years ago. We’re talking about a book that was written by 50 different people, many of which didn’t know each other. A book that’s been translated numerous times. But more than anything, a book that was started off by Moses. 

This guy, Moses, wrote the first 5 books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy aka, the word I used for when I drop a deuce of biblical proportions. 

According to his version of events, Creation occurred a thousand years before he was born. So, how did he know so much about it? There was no Wikipedia back then. Where was he getting his information? 

A lot happens in those first two books. A lot. Creation, Original sin. The promise of Prodigal  Son ( aka the foundation of Christianity) The Great Flood, Sodam and Gomorrah, Moses talking to the burning bush, Moses parting the Red Sea, Moses receiving the Ten Commandments... 

Are you seeing a trend here? 

This guy essentially wrote stories about himself being best friends with God. Doesn’t that seem like a biased narrative?

And by his own accounts, humankind is extremely flawed because of that bitch Eve eating the apple. Doesn’t that in itself, challenge his credibility as an author? 

This is the guy who wrote that homosexuality is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:23)

The guy who wrote that eating shellfish is a sin (Leviticus 11:10) 

The guy who wrote, “If you beat your slave and he dies, who are to be punished, but if your slave gets up after a couple of days, it’s Ok. Because he’s your property. (Exodus 21:20,21)

We’re talking about a book that was written by 50 different people, many of which didn’t know each other. A book that’s been translated numerous times. But more than anything, a book that was started off by Moses. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy, Moses, wrote the first 5 books of the Bible: Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy aka, the word I used for when I drop a deuce of biblical proportions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to his version of events, Creation occurred a thousand years before he was born. So, how did he know so much about it? There was no Wikipedia back then. Where was he getting his information? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot happens in those first two books. A lot. Creation, Original sin. The promise of Prodigal  Son ( aka the foundation of Christianity) The Great Flood, Sodam and Gomorrah, Moses talking to the burning bush, Moses parting the Red Sea, Moses receiving the Ten Commandments... &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you seeing a trend here? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy essentially wrote stories about himself being best friends with God. Doesn’t that seem like a biased narrative?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And by his own accounts, humankind is extremely flawed because of that bitch Eve eating the apple. Doesn’t that in itself, challenge his credibility as an author? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the guy who wrote that homosexuality is an abomination. (Leviticus 18:23)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy who wrote that eating shellfish is a sin (Leviticus 11:10) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The guy who wrote, “If you beat your slave and he dies, who are to be punished, but if your slave gets up after a couple of days, it’s Ok. Because he’s your property. (Exodus 21:20,21)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This guy is praised by Christians. You’ve made a movie about him and he was played by Charlton Heston. In reality, he was the BC Wish version of Kid Rock, and you shouldn’t believe anything he says.&lt;/p&gt;

Is called glossolalia. They really believe this is the baptism of the Holy Spirit.","Probably deceived and/or are deceivers themselves in it for the profit.

They have misinterpreted the spiritual gifts and there is no power behind their speaking this way. When the ancients spoke in tongues, it was because the spirit of God empowered them to do so in order for the gospel to reach others that were of another language.

Not only that, all miracles in the Bible were worked by God in order to authenticate the message and the messenger.

You hear people today speaking in tongues and prophesying. Nobody understands this strange phenomena they are doing, but when they pray healing you do not find the blind, deaf, sick, or crippled healed instantaneously or miraculously the way it is portrayed in the Bible. You do not see the dead being raised either.

One would assume hospitals being emptied out because of faith in the One these messengers proclaim. Unfortunately these things don’t happen today. And there are few occurrences of it happening in the Bible ironically. So why are false teachers acting this way?

My beginning statement. They are either deceived themselves or are deceiving others themselves by some strange phenomenon they claim is the Holy Spirit, which many Christians will deny is the case.",,,,,,

Now to me being perfect isn&amp;#39;t just about not committing a sin or making any mistake, but rather when you do make a mistake you acknowledge it go back to God asking for forgiveness and if it a person you have offended go apologise or confess to the person no matter how hard it is, because that is what separates you from them. Doing the right thing no matter the cost,also try not to look at perfection form the eyes and standards of the world rather God through his word, because if you try to please the world you can never be enough and you end up loosing yourself 
Now Go and be perfect 👌 😌 ✨ 
Thank you 😊&lt;/p&gt;

What is the context here?  Jesus is telling His hearers to love one another as the Father loves us.  The word that ""perfect"" comes from here is the Greek word [teleios](https://biblehub.com/greek/5046.htm), which is more multifaceted than the English word perfect.  In English, we think of perfect as being without any flaw, but teleios is more about being made complete or full.

Perfectionism sets the bar so high that one will eventually become discouraged in their attempt to achieve perfection.  Obviously, we should never intentionally sin, tat should never be our rationale as Christians.",See that is the problem with people. They tell you something you go translate it into something else and get another topic entirely and take things out of context. Are you greek are you latin 🤔,,,,,,,

Most Christians don't consider it Scripture (I think the ancient Ethiopian church does).

However, Jude actually quotes Enoch, which is really interesting.

There is likely some influence happening in the background -- such as the book influencing the way the Jews of Jesus's day thought about certain things.","It's good, but I find Jubilees to be more interesting.","It is particularly important for understanding what resonance the title ""Son of Man"" might have had for a Jewish audience in the 1st century.",,,,,,

The eldest son of a commissioned officer for the British Crown, he was born in Kilkenny, Ireland and graduated from Trinity College, Dublin, with a B.A. degree in 1704. While awaiting a fellowship vacancy, he made a critical study of time, vision, and the hypothesis that there is no material substance, this would become the central philosophical concern for the rest of his life. He argued against Isaac Newton's doctrine of absolute space, time and motion and is seen as a crucial precursor to Einstein. His persuasive powers and personality meant that he was well-received on frequent visits to London, making important connections before embarking on a grand tour of Italy. With his influential connections back in London promising to support him, he began the project of founding a college in Bermuda for training ministers and missionaries. At 43 he married Anne Forster, gave up his benefice in Ireland and went to America on a salary of £100 per annum. He bought a plantation at Middletown and brought to New England John Smibert, a British artist he ""discovered"" in Italy, who is generally regarded as the founding father of American portrait painting. He busied himself by drawing up plans for the ideal city he planned to build on Bermuda and lived at the plantation while he waited for funds for his college to arrive. The funds, however, were not forthcoming. It seemed that distant from London, scepticism and opposition had gathered force; and the Prime Minister, Walpole grew steadily more sceptical and lukewarm.

Whilst Berkeley was in America, the educator Samuel Johnson visited him, and convinced Berkeley to establish a scholarship program at Yale College which had been founded about twenty years earlier.  When Berkley returned to England, he donated a large number of books as well as his plantation to the college.

His ideas would also leave a significant legacy in North America, as Samuel  Johnson took Berkeley's philosophy and used parts of it as a framework for his own American Practical Idealism school of philosophy. As Johnson's philosophy was taught to about half the graduates of American colleges between 1743 and 1776, including half of the contributors to the Declaration of Independence,  it can be argued that Berkeley's ideas were indirectly a foundation of the American Identity.

Many Lutheran churches in America can trace their lineage back to the Evangelical Church in Germany (Evangelische Kirche in Deutschland, or the EKD).

In the US, seeing \{Insert name here\} Evangelical Lutheran Church doesn’t mean that it’s affiliated with the ELCA. The word Evangelical can and is used by LCMS congregations, WELS congregations, and there is such a thing as the Evangelical Lutheran Synod, which would also have congregations of its own.

Regardless of all that, and speaking as a member of the ELCA in North Carolina, the mission of the church is to proclaim the gospel and administer the sacraments of baptism and the Eucharist. This will be true regardless of who is President or who sits on which congressional district.

I’m not an Iowan, so I’m not sure what’s up with the particular district. But your post is a red flag to me. That’s an area where the church has no business getting involved in.

Whether individuals as citizens and residents take a particular stance is one thing. I certainly believe in fighting for my political views using political terms and in the political arena…to call on the church to hold such a view, though, just seems off to me. And it seems to come from one who doesn’t know how the ELCA is built, how it governs, or how it’s even named.","The riots in Portland was becuase of George Floyd. It is political violence but on the opposite end of spectrum. They rioted becuase of what they deemed social injustice while the people at capital stormed it becuse of conspiracy theories. 

I seriously doubt churches can do this. They can simply be another voice but at the end of the day it comes down to the individual person's perspectives and beliefs. Those view's are not shaped overnight or by one alone institution (church, family, friends, school, etc.)",,,,,,

1 Cor 15:12-22 (ESV)

&gt; Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead? But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain. We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised. For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised. And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins. Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied. But now Christ is risen from the dead, and has become the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep. For since by man came death, by Man also came the resurrection of the dead. For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all shall be made alive",It’s a hard question for anyone but faith is the answer,,,,,,

To quote briefly from On Being a Christian: a personal confession by Henry Hermann.


""... They are the words of one who is a Lutheran because he is a Christian - of one who, if he were not a Lutheran, would not be a believer of any kind - of one who sees the only logical alternative to his commitment to the Christian Lutheran faith to be Epicureanism in its popular form: 'Let us eat and drink and be merry, for tomorrow we are dead.' .... I do not mean to say that it is more important to be a Lutheran than to be a Christian. If a Christian is properly described as one who is united with Christ by true faith in Him, then no church affiliation of any kind can be placed on a level with it, let alone on a level above it. To be a Christian, in the sense of accepting the Christian faith, is to be in the only condition in which salvation is possible. ... The sentence 'I am a Lutheran because I am a Christian' asserts (1) that the Christian faith is clearly revealed, (2) that it can be grasped and understood, (3) that it can be accurately stated, taught, and confessed, and (4) that this has been done in traditional Lutheranism.""","I don't know enough about Lutheranism to make a compare/contrast between them. When I read Luther's book, *The Bondage of the Will*, I thought he sounded a lot like a Calvinist.

Calvinism can be boiled down to one point--the absolute sovereignty of God in salvation. In other words, whether we are saved or not is ultimately up to God. God's absolute sovereignty permeates the Bible, so it would take me a book to give you a full blown case for Calvinism. I'll give you a couple of passages and explain why I think they support the Calvinist position, but keep in mind this is not an exhaustive case.

John 6:35-37 ""Jesus said to them, 'I am the bread of life; the one who comes to Me will not be hungry, and the one who believes in Me will never be thirsty. But I said to you that you have indeed seen Me, and yet you do not believe. Everything that the Father gives Me will come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I certainly will not cast out.'""

Coming to Jesus and believe in Jesus both mean the same thing in this passage. Whoever believes in or comes to Jesus will be saved. Jesus tells his audience that they do not believe in him. Then in the very next sentence, he says that all the Father gives him *will* come to him, i.e. believe in him. What follows from that?

Well, Jesus is explaining their unbelief. The reason they don't believe is because they were not given to Jesus by the Father. If anybody is given to Jesus by the Father, then they will believe. If they are *not* given to Jesus by the Father, then they will *not* believe. So whether they believe or not is entirely up to the Father. And since believing leads to salvation, whether you are saved or not is entirely up to the Father.

This theme is repeated a couple of times in John 6, but let me skip over to John 10 for my second argument.

John 10:26-29 ""But you do not believe, because you are not of My sheep. My sheep listen to My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give them eternal life, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand.""

A lot of people think that you *become* Jesus' sheep by believing in him. But it's the other way around. Jesus said the reason they do not believe is because they are not his sheep. It follows that you have to first *be* his sheep *before* you can believe. It isn't because we believe that we are his sheep; it is because we are his sheep that we believe.

And how do we become his sheep? He tells us that, too. The Father has *given* the sheep to Jesus. That's how we become his sheep. Jesus is saying the same thing here as he said in John 6. Once you are Jesus' sheep, then you will hear his voice and follow him.

Your salvation is guaranteed because the Father cannot fail. Nobody who is given to Jesus by the Father will perish because the Father is greater than all, and nobody can snatch you out of his hand.

We can derive all five points of Calvinism from just this one point--the absolute sovereignty of God in salvation.

If God decides who will come to faith in Christ and be saved, then nobody can come to Christ unless God enables him to. We are in such a state of rebellion against God that we are unable to come to Christ apart from God's enablement. That's total depravity.

If salvation is totally up to God, then it must be unconditional. If it were conditioned on our own choices or something about us that God had no control over, then it wouldn't be totally up to God. So God's election must be unconditional.

If God intended to save a specific people and not others, and if he sent Jesus to die to save those people, then he must've only intended Jesus' atonement to be for those he had chosen. That's limited (or particular) atonement. The atonement is limited to a particular group of people--those God intended to save.

If salvation is ultimately up to God, then the decision is entirely his. If the decision is entirely his, then those he decides will come to Jesus will come to Jesus. It's a necessity. Salvation is by the grace of God. In other words, we don't earn it. God gives it freely. That means the grace is irresistable to those God has chosen. If God chooses to bestow his grace on somebody by saving them, then that person will be saved. They can't resist it.

If our salvation is completely determined by God, then those God has chosen to be saved cannot lose their salvation. That's because God can't fail to save anybody he intends to save. That's preserverance of the saints.

So basically what it all boils down to is that God is completely sovereign in our salvation. It's all up to him. And that's Calvinism in a nutshell.",,,,,,

We answer, that all the ceremonies and Sacraments which God instituted in his Word, should be maintained. With respect, however, to the seven Sacraments, we find that the Fathers differed; consequently these seven ceremonies are not all equally necessary.

&gt;[3] If we regard as Sacraments the external signs and ceremonies, which God enjoined, and with which he connected the promise of grace, it is easy to determine what are Sacraments; for ceremonies and other external things, instituted by men, are not Sacraments in this sense; because men cannot promise the grace of God, without divine authority. Signs, therefore, which are instituted without the command of God, are not signs of grace: although they may be memorials to children and to the ignorant, like a painted cross.

&gt;[4] Now Baptism, the Eucharist, and Absolution are true Sacraments; for they are commanded of God, and have the promise of grace, which in reality belongs to, and is the New Testament. For the external signs were instituted to move our hearts, namely, both by the Word and the external signs, to believe, when we are baptized and when we receive the Lord's body, that God will be truly merciful to us, through Christ, [5] as Paul, Rom. 10:17, says: ""Faith cometh by hearing."" As the Word enters our ears, so the external signs are placed before our eyes, inwardly to excite and move the heart to faith. The Word and the external signs work the same thing in our hearts; as Augustine well says: ""The Sacrament is a visible Word;"" for the external sign is like a picture, and signifies the same thing that is preached by the Word; both, therefore, effect the same thing.

&gt;[6] But Confirmation and Extreme Unction are ceremonies, derived from the ancient Fathers, which the church never regarded as necessary to salvation, for they are not enjoined by God; it is therefore well to make a distinction between these and the above, which were instituted by the Word and command of God, and have his promise appended.",,,,,,,https://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p2s2c1a2.htm,

John 3:16-17 (ESV)

&gt; 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life. 17 For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but in order that the world might be saved through him.

1 Tim 2:3-4 (ESV)

&gt; This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior, who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.

Those who will suffer eternal torment have chosen to pay the price for their own sins  and have rejected the free gift of forgiveness and payment for those sins offered and accomplished by God.

God is not limited by the means He has provided to us which He uses to create and strengthen faith - preached Word and sacraments. He can work faith where and when He wills, even in those who cannot comprehend or articulate that faith, like infants (Psa 22:9) or those who have not been reached through evangelism.

Additionally, recall that God has promised not to lose anyone He knew would be in heaven with Him since before the beginning (Revelation 13:8, Ephesians 1:4, 2 Timothy 1:8–9, 1 Peter 1:18–20, Titus 1:2, Ephesians 3:11).

As Christians, we rejoice that our God is not one of justice, giving us what we deserve for we would all be condemned, but one of grace and mercy who sent His Son to suffer, die, and rise again in our place.

Instead, He implied that she was a “dog” and did not deserve the bread that belonged to the children of the household (v. 27). This reflects the common view among first-century Jews that the Gentiles were “dogs.” The Jews did not mean this positively, as dogs were regarded as unclean animals.

But did Jesus’ use of the term “dogs” mean that He thought of Gentiles in the same way that most Jews of His day did? No. We have seen that Christ did not affirm the Jews’ oral traditions regarding cleanness and uncleanness (Mark 7:1–23), so He certainly would not have held to their traditions regarding the inherent uncleanness of Gentiles. He is not insulting her, He is talking about priority. Like good parents, the Father feeds His children (Israel) first and then the dogs (Gentiles). The Gospel must go first to the Jews before it is extended fully to the nations.

True, Jesus was sent to preach the Gospel of the kingdom first to the Jews, but He did not ignore Gentiles. In fact, He healed some men outside of the covenant community before meeting this woman (8:28–34). Jesus is testing her to determine whether she will cling to Him steadfastly. 

Finally, the woman did not view Jesus as ordering her to leave. Her reply was that dogs could eat the lefttovers of whatever was given to the children (v. 28). Note that the woman made no demand of Jesus. She did not contest her status as a “dog”; rather, she pointed out the reality of what happened in those Jewish households that included dogs. For this, Jesus commended her faith (v. 29). Ultimately, the encounter is about the place of Jews and Gentiles in God’s kingdom. The children—the Jews—get presented the kingdom first, and afterward, the dogs—the Gentiles—hear of it as well. This Gentile woman recognized the propriety of that plan. She did not ask for first place but in faith believed that Christ was for her as well.

In today’s passage, the Syrophoenician woman is happy to get the “crumbs of the kingdom.” Dr. R.C. Sproul writes in his commentary *Mark*: “The good news is that in the overflow of mercy and grace that comes to us from the hands of God, though we should be satisfied with crumbs, He is not satisfied with giving us crumbs. He has lavished His grace on us.”","Jesus was comparing her to a dog because she was wicked. No other reason. Wicked people are referred to Dogs often, in the Bible and in modern times

There is a real contradiction in our lives sometimes, we say hey we are saved and yet we are often struggling with a whole lot of Junk still, addictions to porn, ""worldliness"", selfishness etc. This can really get you down and yes this is to hard for you, and yes you do need help.

Some of us combat this by just glossing over whatever rubbish in our lives is there saying it's fine I'm saved just carry on and do whatever.

Some of us try to fix it up, nearly like if I can just fix x, y or z then I'm acceptable to God. If I read enough bible, do some good things, or don't do certain things I'm all good.

There is something in the old Testament Temple that is really pertinent to this whole thing that you would benefit from understanding.

To start with we are completely outside of the temple, we have all of our Guilt and condemnation and filth on our own heads.

So a sinner (which we all are) comes to the realization that they are on a completely messed up path and asks God for salvation, forgiveness of sins past and realizes the sacrifice that has been offered for him. That's at the cross, that is the entrance of the Temple the altar of sacrifice. All your past sins are sorted, forgiven, completely wiped. BUT and you may have struggled with this what about now? I am now a living contradiction, completely cleaned past but still messed up in the present with a whole bunch of junk. It's not enough. But he died once for all.

Move further into the temple into the holy place with the candlestick and bread and incense, ok so we have a clean past but still a life full of Junk, in here we are not moving towards the holy of holies, we have the bread, The life of Jesus that was bread for us, he was light of the world, and the sweet smelling incense. We as a living contradiction - clean past but flawed present can have the perfect life of Jesus applied to us in the present because He lived and lives perfect! This is applied to us in our place! but for sure we have to be accepting and eating the bread, walking in the light. (Maybe there is elements of Bread = the word, oil and light the spirit and being a light, incense prayers and living a fragrant life.) But we can still be this living contradiction, Clean past from what was done at the cross for us, God looking at us as clean because we have Jesus perfection placed on us but we can still be getting fully smashed with our selfish dark and bad habits (whatever they are) and this can cause us all sorts of pain because we can be thinking how can I possibly be right with all this junk still present?

1. Outside the temple full of Junk with no solution
2. clean Past - the cross completely sorts that. But still full of junk
3. Clean present - Jesus's perfection sorts that. Still full of Junk, but covered with perfection.

Then the holy of holies.

The holy of holies, the priest takes the blood and cleans the temple, we are a temple! We submit to God as king on the throne in the holy of holies as we move through and now He starts the cleaning to make us into what he has already declared us to be. And we are filled with the things in there, the presence of God, and His pure law which is ultimately love. At every step the priest did it for us!! So that is really really good news, but it was also done in this order. Entrance, holy place, most holy place.

1. Outside the temple full of Junk with no solution
2. clean Past - the cross completely sorts that. But still full of junk
3. Clean present - Jesus's perfection sorts that. Still full of Junk, but covered with perfection.
4. Being cleansed and filled with the spirit and the love of God - being transformed into what we have been declared to be.

So don't stress if you have problems that seem to be owning you Just give God permission to do this work in you and get out of the way because at each and every step the only power is Christ, He is the great high priest and the blood was carried through each section of the temple. All we can really do is accepting the whole work, each phase by faith.",b777118e-fd62-11e3-add3-12313d187c89,,,,,

And as Paul said:

&gt; “And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God.” Romans‬ ‭12:2‬

Divine Mercy Message For March 11, 2021

And I still have no answer

A few days ago, I wrote to my director (probably Father Andrasz), asking permission for some little sacrifices during Lent. As I did not have the doctor’s permission to go to town, I had to do this by letter. But Ash Wednesday is already here, and I still have no answer. This morning after Holy Communion, I asked Jesus to inspire my director with His light so that he would answer me, and I knew in my soul that Father was not against my practicing these sacrifices for which I had asked permission, and that he would give his permission. So, in peace, I began to undertake these practices. That same afternoon I received a letter from Father, saying that he readily gives me permission to undertake those practices for which I had asked permission. I was very pleased that my interior knowledge was in agreement with my spiritual Father’s opinion. - (Diary 932)",t2_4cbw8k2l,False,,0,False,"Divine Mercy Message For March 11, 2021",[],r/Christianity,False,7,,0,,False,t3_m3l9li,False,dark,0.75,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615595546.0,text,7,,,text,self.Christianity,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

As the Lord has not established a temporal kingdom or state on earth, we are left to exercise our conscience and mind in how to organise our societies. Those that value individualism have so far tended towards a democratic system, where power flows (in theory) upwards from the citizens. 

Therefore, if you object to the practise of capital punishment, rather than falsely claiming God has given you a divine revelation about it, use your voice and vote to influence policy and abolish it.","[From The Lord, Our God and Savior](https://www.thevolumesoftruth.com/The_Judgment_of_God_Is_True_and_Without_Question,_Yet_the_Error_of_the_People_Is_Great) ✉️",,,,,,https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oTPE5maRYPs&amp;list=PLE8FlkxQPQkNatomGOvPp_p6H6M1__E1A&amp;index=1,

Christ’s sacrifice actually removes the sin from us and puts that sin on the cross. That is why the Bible says that Christ took the sins of the world in his own body. When he died he buried those sins. 1 Peter 2:24 Your sins, my sins. Now as a sinless holy person we are able to have the indwelling Spirit of God who stays with us through out our life. This is why Christ’s death was necessary. To bury that sin that we have in our bodies by putting them in Christ’s body on the cross. This is why our bodies are the temple of God and why we should take very good care of it and not participate in any sin but especially sexual sin. 1 Cor 6:18",,,,,,,,

Some trees are strong and mighty, their branches stretching out to me and growing towards me, others are small and meek. But no matter what, man will still look up at these trees and admire their beautiful leaves and fruit.


You too will produce leaves and fruit. You worry that you may not be mighty as the trees on the hills, but rest assured, in due time, you will grow into a mighty tree like them. Even greater, for they rely on the hill to make them higher than the tree on flat land.


You also wish to be the tree that holds onto its leaves during the winters? Know that no two trees were planted the same way. Each tree is designed to withstand their elements, some have to die and give up their clinging dead leaves for the winter in order to sprout new leaves. For that is what is meant for them. 


So do not worry which tree you are, know that every tree will bring life. Take a look at the insects and the birds, they come to you for food and shelter, as you should provide for all my people, and for people who are against you.

It seems, though, that there is some misrepresentation or misinterpretation of what *sola scriptura* and inerrancy suggests about practice and about the origin of Scripture. I will note a couple areas I read with confusion, but obviously I do not cover all in this one comment.

I do find interesting that the author begins by stating that ""the Church has always held that the Scriptures are free from error,"" but he doesn't really seem to specifically define what that means or how to apply it in ways that are also not challenged by his challenges.

Writing things like ""It is reflected in the wide range of doctrinal positions and practices held by communities all claiming to be “accurately” following the same infallible rule"" seems to misunderstand what *sola scriptura* and inerrancy are understood to lead to. Is not the Eastern Church supposedly following the same infallible rule of the Church, yet still able to contain a wide range of doctrinal positions and practices? Similarly, Scripture is the infallible rule, and what it teaches absolutely we believe absolutely, but much else is given freedom, liberty. Here is an excerpt from [Understanding Sola Scriptura](https://www.ligonier.org/blog/understanding-sola-scriptura/) from Ligonier Ministries:

&gt;There are other extremes against which the doctrine of *sola Scriptura* protects us. While we certainly want to avoid the individualistic and ahistorical posture of many churches today, *sola Scriptura* also protects us from overcorrecting and raising creeds and confessions or other human documents (or ideas) to the level of Scripture. We must always be on guard against making the same mistake as Rome and embracing what we might call “traditionalism,” which attempts to bind the consciences of Christians in areas that the Bible does not. In this sense, *sola Scriptura* is a guardian of Christian liberty. 

In addition, ""autographic text"" does not have to be as strict as the author seems to state in order for it to be a real and useful term. I do not think the authors of the Chicago Statement deny that Scripture could have been compiled and amended. Each separate piece written would be the autographic text, and each amendment - provided it is authentically written with authority and inspired by the Spirit - would be part of the autograph as well. The author seems to indicate confusion on the part of Protestantism in this matter without waiting for responses to the questions he asks, questions which do have answers.","Seeing lots of ""God is a genocidal maniac"" comments lately.

201,,Christianity,"~Long-ish story/ happy rant incoming~

Here’s some background information. I’m a Christian, and have been for a few years, but I hit a really rough patch these last few months. There has been a death in my family, I’ve been depressed and unmotivated, my ADHD got worse, and I saw myself become more and more distant from God. 

I was getting behind on my schoolwork, I lost interest in my hobbies, I had stopped praying, and I stopped reading the Bible. 

Things were getting worse and worse for me, so out of desperation I begged God yesterday to show me a sign if He really cared about me. And boy, did He give me a sign.

Today started relatively normal, and I didn’t notice anything crazy about it, other than that my classes were easier. 

Then around noon, some family friends came over and surprised us with a cake, which coincidentally was my favorite flavor of cake (red velvet). I didn’t think too much of it but I was really grateful. 

After my zoom meetings were over, my day really started getting good. I was able to finish all my homework for the day in an hour, something that hasn’t happened in a while. I felt energized and I was actually able to focus on my work and it seemed my ADHD symptoms were gone. I was super happy with no explanation.

Then something told me I really, REALLY needed to go on a walk. So I left the house and went on a walk. 

Not even exaggerating, I saw the most awe-inspiring weather I have ever seen in my life. 
To the south, the sky was beautifully clear, like a summer day. To the north, the sky looked so dark that it looked like the world ended 1000 feet from me, almost like when you look into the distance on Minecraft and your render distance is low. I genuinely had to do a few reality checks because it was that disorienting. To the west, the clouds looked like what pictures of heaven look like— there were clouds, and the sun was shining above them in a way that it looked like heaven. There’s no other way to describe it.

And to the east, there was a rainbow.

Oddly, there was no one else in the neighborhood, but I’m honestly glad because otherwise they would’ve seen me grinning like an idiot at how amazing it all looked and felt. I knew instantly that God was behind it, and I did cry happy tears realizing that He has always cared about me and that He really does listen to me.

I’ll add pictures later, for some reason it won’t let me add them from my phone.

202,,Christianity,"A lot of folks on the internet claim that the gospels weren't written by their namesakes Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.  According to skeptics such as myself, the gospels were originally anonymous, and only attributed to the traditional evangelists years later, perhaps in the late first or even up to the mid-second century.

Of course, Christians aren't going to want to take the word of some random internet dude---they're going to want evidence.  And while I can't present *all* the evidence here, I believe it would be interesting for those unfamiliar to give a brief overview.

I would like to consider first the evidence in favor of authenticity.  To begin, all our earliest complete manuscript copies of the gospels, without exception, bear the names of the traditional authors.  Moreover, all the surviving ancient commentators agree that they are authentic.  In other words, the historical records are absolutely unanimous in affirming the authenticity of the gospels, with not even a single dissenting voice.

At first blush, this can seem very convincing, but if you scratch the surface it quickly becomes clear that this evidence in favor of authenticity is shaky at best.  It turns out that we don't have any unambiguous attributions until approximately 180 CE, far too late to establish that the gospels weren't originally anonymous and then given their titles later on.

The only possible earlier commentator is Papias, who wrote circa 95-110 CE.  He doesn't discuss Luke or John, but claims that Matthew the apostle wrote down the sayings of Jesus in a Hebrew dialect, and that Mark wrote down in non-chronological order the preaching of Peter.  There are several problems with this testimony, not the least of which is that we don't actually have what Papias wrote.  Instead we have quotations from circa 320 CE by the historian Eusebius, who himself distrusts Papias, and explicitly describes him as 'a man of little intelligence'.

The manuscript tradition isn't any more encouraging.  There are extremely few Greek manuscripts (as far as I know, only P4, P66, P75) from before the fourth century---and none before 180 CE---that contain the names of any gospel author.  But again, 180 CE is far too late to establish authenticity.

There are other purported arguments for traditional authorship, for instance about the identity and role of the beloved disciple in John's gospel.  But those arguments are largely speculative and even less convincing than the external evidences, so I will not cover them here.

So much, then, for the evidence in favor of authenticity.  What can be said in opposition?

Most Christians are probably aware that there are a lot of inauthentic gospels written by early Christians.  These include but are not limited to the Gospel of Peter, of Mary Magdalene, of Judas, of Thomas, of Nicodemus, and so on.  There are also a number of anonymous gospels, for instance the Gospel of Truth, the Gospel of the Savior, of the Nazoreans, of the Egyptians, of the Ebionites, and of the Hebrews.

So, even assuming the canonical gospels are authentic, there are still a greater number inauthentic gospels, as well as a greater number of anonymous gospels.  In other words, anonymity and false attributions were the rule of the day, not the exception.

More can be said about anonymity.  The canonical gospels are quoted frequently in the period 90-180 CE, but never cited by name.  The first church father to explicitly mention the gospels is Justin Martyr, writing circa 160 CE, who generically calls them 'memoirs of the apostles', or in the case of Mark's gospel, the 'memoirs of Peter'.  Never does he attribute them to their namesakes, or call them by their titles.

It's only in 180 CE that the canonical gospels are finally given their modern titles and ascriptions in the historical record.  This is easy to explain if they were originally anonymous, but hard to explain otherwise.

In the case of Matthew and John, another important reason for rejecting authenticity is that they were Galilean Jews who probably spoke Aramaic as a first language and were unlikely to be literate even in that.  In contrast, their gospels are written in polished Greek.

Then there is the issue of Markan priority.  It is thought by most scholars, based on internal analysis (which is surprisingly accessible to laypersons who care to take a look) that Mark's gospel was written first, and then Matthew and Luke copied from him.  This is not a problem for Lukan authorship, but if Matthew really wrote the Gospel that bears his name, it becomes very difficult indeed to explain why he is relying on a non-eyewitness as a source.  This is even more puzzling when one realizes that Matthew's gospel doesn't give any insight into Matthew's thoughts or character.  In fact, Matthew only appears once in the narrative portion of the gospel (Mt 9:9-13).  It is copied directly from Mark, and the only personal detail that Matthew adds (or perhaps flubs) is to change his name from 'Levi' to 'Matthew'.  Under the well-evidenced assumption of Markan priority, this would have been an utterly incredible thing for Matthew to have done.

In the case of John's gospel, the beloved disciple is explicitly said to be a source for it, not the author.  We read in John 21:24,

*This is the disciple who testifies to these things and who wrote them down. We know that his testimony is true.*

Please note the distinction between the first person 'we' used by the author, and the third-person 'his' used to refer to the beloved disciple.  (And yes, this reflects the original Greek conjugations.)  Again, this would have been an incredible way for an eyewitness like John to write about himself.

""The LORD gives knowledge and reason.""

""Not even angels or demons can come between you and the love of Christ Jesus the LORD.""","I've made some big mistakes in my past life. These are some great verses that cheer me up whenever i ask whether i should turn myself in.

Luke 19:8-10

**But Zacchaeus stood up and said to the Lord, “Look, Lord! Here and now I give half of my possessions to the poor, and if I have cheated anybody out of anything, I will pay back four times the amount.”**

**Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because this man, too, is a son of Abraham. For the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.”**

Luke 3:12-14

**Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?”**

**“Don’t collect any more than you are required to,” he told them.**

**Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?”**

**He replied, “Don’t extort money and don’t accuse people falsely—be content with your pay.”**

The tax collectors in Luke 3 obviously stole (otherwise why would John tell them not to collect any more than they are required to) and theft was punishable by roman law. But John the Baptist did not tell them to turn themselves in and confess their crimes. Rather he basically told them to stop their evil ways and change. 

Zaccheaeus stole as we can see he even admitted. But Jesus did not tell him to report himself to the soldiers. He instead said that Salvation had come to his house.

I'm not an authority. I'm a 17 yr old guy so don't take my words like you would take your local pastor's words.  But this is what I believe through my study of scripture. That anyone can change and it doesn't mean you have to report yourself to the police. Even if you where a serial rapist/killer, Jesus still died for your sins. 

Hope this helps.",,,,,,

Seriously, though, this sounds like an anxiety spiral. You're freaking out about being a decade away from being a decade away etc. etc.. Fifty isn't even ""that old"" anymore.","There are some verses in the Bible which spoke to me about living and dying, or rather what happens at the end of my life.

“He has made everything beautiful in its time. He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.”
‭‭Ecclesiastes‬ ‭3:11‬ ‭NIV‬‬

“Just as people are destined to die once, and after that to face judgment, so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many; and he will appear a second time, not to bear sin, but to bring salvation to those who are waiting for him.”
‭‭Hebrews‬ ‭9:27-28‬ ‭NIV‬‬

We will keep growing older each day and die one day. Where will be go after that? If God is truly the one who placed eternity in our hearts so that we may long for what’s eternal, then we need to believe in God, know that He was the one who made us, knows us and has a purpose for our existence. 

“For he says, “In the time of my favor I heard you, and in the day of salvation I helped you.” I tell you, now is the time of God’s favor, now is the day of salvation.”
‭‭2 Corinthians‬ ‭6:2‬ ‭NIV‬‬

Perhaps as you seek here, you will find some answers that lead you to believe in God.

I was 16 when I literally felt helpless and lost knowing that one day I will die, perhaps fade into nothingness. It was a great comfort knowing that I am not nothing, I will not end up as nothing and my life now can count and not be treated as nothing.

Can I pray for you?",b777118e-fd62-11e3-add3-12313d187c89,,,,,

As someone new to the faith, I could sense that I was being directly attacked by something I couldn’t quite feel. But it was not from God, to be sure.

See, I’ve had a lot of A N X I E T Y, about living a Christian life. I thought everything I did was a sin. From playing COD with my friends, (although I DARE not harm another physical human being. That’s just plain wrong.), to having actual fun and enjoying the life God’s given me, to even the fast food I sometimes enjoy.I was incredibly scrupulous and miserable.

I’ve reached out on Reddit several times before, and God bless everyone who’s helped me during this rough time. But I realized that I’ve been blessed beyond measure from God himself. A verse continually came up in my mind, although I fail to remember the exact notation it has.

“For God did not give us a spirit of fear, but a spirit that cries “Abba, Father!”

And when I woke up today, I realized something. God is not a God of needless rules and restrictive regulations. God is a GOOD and HOLY God, who loves righteousness and hates evil. I realized that what God says about Sin is for our own good, and I believe him. I was so worried that I was doing Christianity the “wrong way.” So I obsessed over everything I did. I constantly condemned myself. Now I realize I’m free to actually... enjoy my life that he’s given me.

 I’ve committed Sins in my past, but I no longer follow them as I once did. I try my best to do the right thing, but I know that I’m sealed, saved, and chosen by Christ because I’ve placed my faith in him. I can actually rest and enjoy God’s blessings that are present in my life. I’ll never be perfect, but I can try to do some good, because I know it pleases God. Faith alone saves, but I actually WANT to do some good and please Him. I’ll never get it 100% right, but hey, I know that I am loved by God because I’ve placed faith in his only Son. If we could get it 100% right all the time, then why did Jesus die?  He died so that we can be free of the eternal consequences our Sins bring us, and we can have a new life. I don’t want to Sin, but he is my advocate, not my accuser. 

Now, I try to read the life of Christ and align myself with His teachings as best I can, knowing that I am no longer under God’s condemnation. My every “screw-up” is covered, and I am free to pursue righteousness. I’m free to stop constantly condemning myself. I felt like everything’s changed now.

  Does the Bible Teach ‘Once Saved, Always Saved’?

The Bible’s answer  —

No,  it does not teach the doctrine of ‘once saved, always saved.’ A person  who has gained salvation by faith in Jesus Christ can lose that faith  and the salvation that comes with it. The Bible says that maintaining  faith requires great effort, a “hard fight.” Jude 3,5) Early Christians who had already accepted Christ were told: “Keep working out your own salvation with fear and trembling.”​Philippians 2:12

Bible verses that disprove the teaching of ‘once saved, always saved’

The Bible warns against serious sins that will keep a person from entering God’s Kingdom. (1 Corinthians 6:9-11; Galatians 5:19-21 Galatians 5:​19-​21)  If salvation could not be lost, such warnings would be meaningless.  Instead, the Bible shows that someone who has been saved can fall away  by returning to a practice of serious sin. For example, Hebrews10:26  states: “If we practice sin willfully after having received the  accurate knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice for  sins left.”Hebrews 6:4-6; 2 Peter 2:​20-​22.

Jesus emphasized the importance of maintaining faith by giving an  illustration in which he likened himself to a vine and his followers to  branches on that vine. Some of them would at one time demonstrate faith  in him by their fruits, or actions, yet would later fail to do so and be  “thrown out like a \[fruitless\] branch,” losing their salvation. John 15:1-6) The apostle Paul used a similar illustration, saying that Christians who do not maintain their faith “will be lopped off.”​—Romans 11:17-22

Christians are commanded to “keep on the watch.” (Matthew 24:42; 25:13)  Those who fall asleep spiritually, whether by practicing “works  belonging to darkness” or by not fully performing the works that Jesus  commanded, lose their salvation.​—Romans 13:11-13; Revelation 3:1-3

Many scriptures show that those who have been saved must still endure faithfully to the end. (Matthew 24:13; Hebrews 10:36; 12:2,3: Revelation 2:10) First-century Christians expressed joy when they learned that fellow believers were enduring in their faith. (1 Thessalonians 1:2,3; 3John 3,4) Does it seem reasonable that the Bible would stress faithful endurance if those who did not endure would be saved anyway?

Only when his death was imminent did the apostle Paul feel that his salvation was assured. (2 Timothy 4:6-8)  Earlier in his life, he recognized that he could still miss out on  salvation if he gave in to fleshly desires. He wrote: “I pummel my body  and lead it as a slave, so that after I have preached to others, I  myself should not become disapproved somehow.”​—1 Corinthians 9:27; Philippians 3:12-14","Like God told samuel when he was looking for the next king of isreal. Only he knows what is in the heart. We can always do the same sin but if in our hearts, we truly want to change but fail and we believein jesus, then jesus' sacrifice covers us. And this covers all sins, no matter what it is. Depends our spiritual life with God determines our salvation","The Bible has several passages to show that we can lose our salvation. Take this verse for example:

&gt; “For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses” (Mathew 6:14-15)

Also the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant in Matthew 18 - the servant was forgiven of a large debt, but failed to forgive a small debt of someone else. So his master handed him over to the jailers to be tortured. Jesus said, “So My heavenly Father also will do to you if each of you, from his heart, does not forgive his brother his trespasses.” Matthew‬ ‭18:35‬ 

Another quote from Jesus:

&gt; “I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I could wish you were cold or hot. So then, because you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will vomit you out of My mouth.” ‭‭Revelation‬ ‭3:15-16‬ 

So Jesus commands that we repent, and that we keep walking in the light. If we become lukewarm, defiant of God, or unforgiving, God will not forgive us of our sins.",,,,,,

So, the more honest and forthright we are, regardless of the action we take, the easier it will be for God to reach us, and show us what we need to see to really be done with that impulse.

Being disciplined is a mercy. When the Lord offers us a way out, it will come in the form of a loss of impulse. And we should accept that loss as grace, and move on.","The old covenant was responded to by ""all that the Lord has said we will do"".  That is the old covenant response.  God make me stronger so I can do it.

You can't do it. 

What you can do is accept the gift, all you sins are wiped, but this isn't enough you still have just as much desire to do wrong as before, and you will stuff up, sin and selfishness will flow.  At this point you realize it is a problem so you might try and fight it, the standard is God's law which is perfection, which is God likeness... so we go ahead and try to be God like and we will fail

Next God gives us the perfect life of Jesus Christ, so when we are making all this sinful, selfish mistakes He looks at us and sees only perfection, we accept this by faith also... but it still isn't good enough because we still have the underlying sin problem.  Maybe we will fall into another trap and realize the great gift and excuse sinfulness and selfishness this is ultimately trampling on the gift that was given.  but we can't fix it, maybe we will keep trying.

We have been declared right, we have been covered with righteousness, now IF we will allow it God will recreate us into what He has already declared us to be.  This is found in the holy of holies, the presense of the most High and His standard.  He will write on our hearts with the ink of the spirit and unlike the law of stone which is external we are literally transformed into a living version of that and filled with His presence.

What can we do?  seek it, and allow it and cooperate with complete honesty before God.",,,,,,,

If #1 is correct then there is no reason to leave it, and if #2 is correct, how can a true church spring out of a false church? #1 is bolstered by the fact that, Christ promises in Matthew 28 to “be with you always, even unto the end of the age,” and that Christ promised that the “gates of hell will never prevail.” If the church fell into heresy and became a false church then Christ lied, and if it did not, then the reformation was unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;

They came out of the same church, have the same Bible.

If you are a Christian, the Bible is the ultimate truth.

So, if you keep by the Bible, you are a right church.

The only question now is, how is it interpreted. Thankfully, you already provided a perfect example: How does Christ saying that Hell will never prevail relate to heresy inside the church? For you it might make sense, for me it just means that Jesus will always win in the end. Also, why does Jesus warn of false priests if there would never be any corruption in the ""true church""?

So, you will always be able to bash your heads in with each other about what the right interpretation is, claiming the other is a false Christian, heretic etc., even though both are referring to the same words, the same Bible, the same truth.","A third option is that much of the Church was ""false"" or corrupted in some way over time, but there was still a remnant that was ""true."" This has been observed in history multiple times, as recorded in Scripture. The Church was not, then, completely false, and therefore Christ did not lie, and the correction could come from that remnant and returning to earlier teaching. The Church losing - the gates of hell prevailing, maybe - would be the Church being completely destroyed or powerless. The Reformation coming about and reforming would be demonstrating that the Church was *not* fully gone.","The argument completely fails to address the orthodox church and the possibility both the reformed and catholic church are false.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;If the church fell into heresy and became a false church then Christ lied

Depending on how you view heresy, the church rejecting the geocentric universe and accepting evolution could be seen as heresy.

After that, I felt compelled to start reading the Bible for the first time in my life and read His word.
Like you, I spent a long time wanting to find Christ, but I had too many doubts to fully surrender myself. It was only after prayer that I felt the undeniable love and passion of Him.

That's just something we live with most of the time, and it only becomes a problem when people start reading Scripture with a microscope and making life-changing or life-destroying theological assertions based on isolated words.

Obviously, neither Moses' proto-Israel, Paul's Roman Empire, nor Luther's Germany had same-sex spouses.  They did have a lot of obviously unsavory practices like sexual abuse of slaves and creepy borderline-coercive sex with social underlings, often younger.  Plus a lot of garden-variety adultery and fornication that happened to be same-sex. 

It's pretty bold to assert, as anti-gay Christians do, that Moses and Paul foresaw everything that modern English-speakers classify under ""homosexuality"" and intended their words to match that definition exactly.  It seems a lot more realistic to suggest that they were not writing imaginative science fiction, but were writing about the situations that actually existed in the worlds they were writing in.

There's no single slam-dunk debate-ending word (we should generally not expect to find such words), so the broader themes of Scripture, the witness of other Christians, plenty of prayer, etc. should all play a role in figuring this out.","If we're going to accuse English Bibles of mistranslation, shouldn't we be referring to the Bible in its original languages instead of German?

Here are a few verses:-

“God, who comforts those who are downhearted.” (2 Corinthians 7:6)

“A joyful heart is good medicine.”—Proverbs 17:22.

“You have seen my affliction; you are aware of my deep distress.”—Psalm 31:7.

John 16:33
""I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.""

Romans 8:31
What, then, shall we say in response to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?

Psalm 51:17 A heart broken and crushed, O God, you will not reject.

“You have taken account of my miseries; Put my tears in Your bottle. Are they not in Your book?” ‭‭Psalms‬ ‭56:8‬ ‭

“During all their distress it was distressing to him. . . . In his love and compassion . . . , he lifted them up.”—Isaiah 63:9.

“Trust God all the time. Tell him all your problems, because God is our protection” (Psalm 62:8 NCV). 

GOD who made you has something to say to you; the God who formed you in the womb wants to help you. 
Isaiah 44:2 MSG

He was from a church that held that Christians should worship on the Sabbath (similar to the [Seventh-day Adventists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seventh-day_Adventist_Church)), which meant Saturday in accordance with Jewish tradition. He connected it with God resting on the seventh day following creation (thus making him a [seventh-day sabbatarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath_in_seventh-day_churches)) and to drive home his point that the seventh day was Saturday, he pulled out the [Merriam Webster definition of Saturday](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Saturday).

I responded saying that this was true in America where we were, but not in Germany and other European countries in which Monday is the first day of the week (see [this map](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:First_Day_of_Week_World_Map.svg)). Thus for them, Saturday is the 6th day and Sunday is the 7th day.

The missionary really had trouble getting his head around this (seriously, when I changed my phone from Sunday as the first day to Monday as the first day, he just could not grasp what was going on and thought I was changing the names of the days of the week).

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/Christianity) if you have any questions or concerns.*"," Our behaviors right or wrong are God's problem to sort out... so there is no point even stressing about them although we are owned by the old covenant response of ""all that you have said we will do"".... or I will take on my shoulders the burden of being God like and keeping His laws... or my understanding of them which will be certainly faulty. 

There is a real contradiction in our lives sometimes, we say hey we are saved and yet we are often struggling with a whole lot of Junk still, addictions to porn, ""worldliness"", selfishness etc. This can really get you down.

Some of us combat this by just glossing over whatever rubbish in our lives is there saying it's fine I'm saved just carry on and do whatever.

Some of us try to fix it up, nearly like if I can just fix x, y or z then I'm acceptable to God. If I read enough bible, do some good things, or don't do certain things I'm all good.

I think there is something in the old Testament Temple that is really pertinent to this whole thing that we would benefit from understanding.

To start with we are completely outside of the temple, we have all of our Guilt and condemnation and filth on our own heads.

So a sinner (which we all are) comes to the realization that they are on a completely messed up path and asks God for salvation, forgiveness of sins past and realizes the sacrifice that has been offered for him. That's at the cross, that is the entrance of the Temple the altar of sacrifice. All your past sins are sorted, forgiven, completely wiped. BUT and you may have struggled with this what about now? I am now a living contradiction, completely cleaned past but still messed up in the present with a whole bunch of junk. It's not enough. But he died once for all.

Move further into the temple into the holy place with the candlestick and bread and incense, ok so we have a clean past but still a life full of Junk, in here we are not moving towards the holy of holies, we have the bread, The life of Jesus that was bread for us, he was light of the world, and the sweet smelling incense. We as a living contradiction - clean past but flawed present can have the perfect life of Jesus applied to us in the present because He lived and lives perfect! This is applied to us in our place! but for sure we have to be accepting and eating the bread, walking in the light. (Maybe there is elements of Bread = the word, oil and light the spirit and being a light, incense prayers and living a fragrant life.) But we can still be this living contradiction, Clean past from what was done at the cross for us, God looking at us as clean because we have Jesus perfection placed on us but we can still be getting fully smashed with our selfish dark and bad habits (whatever they are) and this can cause us all sorts of pain because we can be thinking how can I possibly be right with all this junk still present?

1. Outside the temple full of Junk with no solution
2. clean Past - the cross completely sorts that. But still full of junk
3. Clean present - Jesus's perfection sorts that. Still full of Junk, but covered with perfection.

Then the holy of holies.

The holy of holies, the priest takes the blood and cleans the temple, we are a temple! We submit to God as king on the throne in the holy of holies as we move through and now He starts the cleaning to make us into what he has already declared us to be. And we are filled with the things in there, the presence of God, and His pure law which is ultimately love. At every step the priest did it for us!! So that is really really good news, but it was also done in this order. Entrance, holy place, most holy place.

1. Outside the temple full of Junk with no solution
2. clean Past - the cross completely sorts that. But still full of junk
3. Clean present - Jesus's perfection sorts that. Still full of Junk, but covered with perfection.
4. Being cleansed and filled with the spirit and the love of God - being transformed into what we have been declared to be.

So don't stress if you have problems that seem to be owning you Just give God permission to do this work in you and get out of the way because at each and every step the only power is Christ, He is the great high priest and the blood was carried through each section of the temple. All we can really do is accepting the whole work, each phase by faith.

Anything undesirable in God's eyes in our lives is His problem to sort out, He is only love and goodness and it will work out in our best interest and for our happiness.  Our only thing to do is to truly let God in with complete honesty there will never be true peace without this.  God knows what to sort out in us, when to do it, how to do it and why to do it... we don't.  So ask Him to do this, give Him permission daily to fill you with His thoughts and motives and seek for Him with all your heart, mind soul and strength.","Your existence doesn’t mean you are going to hell. You are a unique individual created by God (Psalm 139:14) I think you are right that it is quite difficult for someone who’s heterosexual to  understand what you are going through, the attractions, the yearnings, the struggles... perhaps when one experiences the struggles personally or know someone personally who does, loves them and suffers with them, one can empathize a little better. I have recently found out that one of my loved ones is in a same sex relationship and I really struggle. I love her and I really don’t know what to do. I’ve cried many times over this, raised my fists at God, questioned God’s Word, been convinced of His truth not mine thereafter, then felt helpless all over again. It’s different when you suffer together with the person, as the person. My position hasn’t changed but my perspective and understanding has changed, what it means to love someone, pray for someone and suffer as you intercede. 

St. Augustine says:
‘You have made us for yourself, O Lord, and our hearts are restless until they rest in you.’

Matthew 6:21
“For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.”
‭‭Matthew‬ ‭6:21‬ ‭NIV‬‬

I’m still learning how to make Jesus Christ my treasure, that all things in my life pales in comparison to Him.

Praying that God will guide you through all these struggles you experience and always remind you the He will never leave you nor forsake you. Perhaps if you are comfortable and willing, can PM me and I can pray for you? Press on (Heb 12:1-2)",,,,,,

241,,Christianity,"This is just some curious questions but basically

Why do you guys confess your sins to a priest who speaks to God on your behalf or forgives your sins on His behalf? Assuming we read and study the same bible as Catholics is just another branch of Christianity, doesn't the bible say that only jesus is the way to heaven? And that we should confess our sins to him and him alone? Doesn't the bible say to cast your burdens onto Christ alone and he will give you rest? The bible doesn't tell us to place our trust in man at least as far as I know (correct me if I'm wrong)

Question 2. Why do you pray to Mary or why do you consider her to be sinless and perfect?

The bible teaches that Mary wasn't perfect, she was sinful like us but she followed God and feared God, she found favor with him and he chose her to give birth to Christ, while it's true she gave birth to Christ in human form, Christ in his true form has always existed, Mary was simply a vessel to bring him into the world and nothing more, she's not this all powerful sinless mother of God who can influence his actions. If this is found in scripture let me know.


Lastly Why do you believe in purgatory?

According to Scripture there's no such thing as purgatory, there's only two places, Heaven or Hell/Sheol/Hades/Death or whatever name you want to call it that means second death,

Wherever you stand with Christ on judgement day determines your eternal resting place,

There's no redemption ark or cleansing period after you die in your sins, at least it doesn't say that anywhere in the King James version of the bible, if anything the closest thing to purgatory we have is here on earth, this is our redemption ark, this is our cleansing period.


Again I'm not bashing on anyones religion....or maybe I am, the bible does say the world hates those who speak the truth or who convicts them if their wrongdoing because they hate to be told they're in the wrong... But regardless whether I'm bashing your side of religion or not I'm still curious and could use some enlightened answers so I can understand the catholic side of Christianity.

It details four different scenarios, or four degrees of culpability before God.

Jesus presented the parable based on the analogy of a servant and their master. The parable speaks to the idea of Purgatory (a purely temporary state before we enter into Heaven), Heaven it’s self, Hell, and the idea of invincible ignorance (i.e. those who are saved despite their ignorance of Christ). Either way, Catholics believe that everyone ends up in either Heaven or Hell, without question.

https://youtu.be/YesD9TjrUes","Arghh.... to many questions,  I'm not bouncing through all that! I'll talk about Confession only and keep a focal point gezzz... ok so I don't care about opinions of Scripture or other scripture here is a few on Confession for you 




Is Confession in Scripture?

 

BEGINNING WITH THE OLD

The Catholic Church acknowledges what Scripture unequivocally declares: it is God who forgives our sins. But that is not the end of the story. Leviticus 19:20-22 is equally unequivocal:

If a man lies carnally with a woman… they shall not be put to death… But he shall bring a guilt offering for himself to the Lord… And the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the Lord for his sin which he has committed; and the sin which he has committed shall be forgiven him.

""Apparently, a priest being used as God’s instrument of forgiveness did not somehow take away from the fact that it was God who did the forgiving. God was the first cause of the forgiveness; the priest was the secondary, or instrumental cause. Thus, God being the forgiver of sins in Isaiah 43:25 and Psalm 103:3 in no way eliminates the possibility of there being a ministerial priesthood established by God to communicate his forgiveness.""

OUT WITH THE OLD

Many Protestants will concede the point of priests acting as mediators of forgiveness in the Old Testament. “However,” they will claim, “The people of God had priests in the Old Testament. Jesus is our only priest in the New Testament.” The question is: could it be that “our great God and Savior Jesus Christ” (Titus 2:13) did something similar to that which he did, as God, in the Old Testament? Could he have established a priesthood to mediate his forgiveness in the New Testament?

IN WITH THE NEW

Just as God empowered his priests to be instruments of forgiveness in the Old Testament, the God/man Jesus Christ delegated authority to his New Testament ministers to act as mediators of reconciliation as well. Jesus made this remarkably clear in John 20:21-23:

Jesus said to them again, “Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you.” And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”",ab3672a0-4d66-11e2-9392-12313d14a568,,,,,

It started with Paul for me and I began being scared to read his letters. All the arguments at Paul were making sense to me and I began to fully doubt his motives and his relationship with Christ.

There were absolutely competing views in the early Church, and Paul was an unashamed and eager advocate for his position.  One can also make a pretty compelling case that Paul was a bit of a pretentious jerk.

None of this means squat.  The only perfect person on the planet ever has been Jesus Christ, so it doesn't matter that Paul's head was as big as a house and that he and some of the Apostles didn't always see eye-to-eye.  God used Paul's ego to spread the Church and used the differences between Peter and Paul to grow the Church.

Must people that focus on such nonsense are trying to shake people's faith in Christianity as a whole, but, in the end, such people are saying ""Paul wasn't perfect"" ... truth is, he wasn't.  Neither am I, neither are you.

Now, there is also a group of Christians who claim that Paul ""hijacked"" the ""true Christian"" church.  To those, I simply say, read the book of James or Jude, the other side is expressed quite clearly and defended cogently (though James Greek wasn't as good as Paul's, James certainly got to the point far more efficiently than Paul's rambling), so why attempt to scare others into your point of view.  The Bible makes it clear that there was disagreement and fairly represents both sides of the debate.  Most importantly, it made it clear that these are not points over which we should divide.","Do not listen to these scaremongers they do not read the WORD in Context and then take it out of context and make up lies.

There is nothing wrong with the letters that Paul wrote to the churches  of Father God in Messiah Yeshua.

SS. Bishop John Fisher and Thomas More

The remarkable John Fisher entered Cambridge at the age of 14; he was ordained a priest in 1491 at the age of 22; and ten years later he became vice-chancellor, rising to chancellor of his beloved university in 1504. The same year, he was named the Bishop of Rochester.

He would be confessor to the mother of King Henry VII, and possibly also a tutor to the prince who would become Henry VIII – and order Fisher’s execution.

When Henry sought to end his marriage with his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, a hearing was held at the Legatine Court. Bishop Fisher served as counsel to the queen.

When Catherine stood on her own to make her case, it was simple, powerful – and affecting. She had borne Henry’s children, including three sons who had died; she asserted that at the time of their marriage, “I was a true maid without touch of man.” And finally, she reminded Henry that the pope had issued a bull confirming her marriage to be valid.

Even a gathering of tamed bishops could be chastened. Nevertheless, the fix was in. Henry declared that the bishops unanimously accepted his case, and the Archbishop of Canterbury chimed in that “all my brethren here present will affirm the same.”

But the moment was quickly broken when Bishop Fisher said, with firmness, “No sir, not I. You have not my consent thereto.” And that set him on the course leading to his execution.

Along the way, the King tried to have Fisher poisoned, but he had forgotten that Fisher was ascetic. Fisher ate nothing, but his servant, cleaning up, died.

Fisher and his soulmate, the Sainted Thomas More sought to preserve a civil deference to the king even as they refused to take an oath that Henry was now the Supreme head of the Church in England. The Succession Act would dissolve in a stroke the claim of Rome to authority over priests and churches, and the dutiful attachment of the faithful.

With a long, distinguished career in law, diplomacy, and the repressing of heretics, More had risen to become Lord Chancellor. He had become along the way an intimate of Henry’s; still he could remark, with an unshakeable sobriety, that “if my head would win \[Henry\] a castle in France, it should not fail to go.”

Of the legends of Thomas More so much has been heard, but far less attention has been given to Fisher. And yet Fisher’s story reveals a record of courage and conviction not any shade less than that of More’s. For they shared the same depth of faith that alone could explain why both men were able to move so cheerily to their deaths – and sainthood.

But that story is recalled now and linked, in the most telling way, to the story of More, with Robert Conrad’s new book (forthcoming from St. Benedict Press), John Fisher and Thomas More: Keeping Their Souls While Losing Their Heads. More remarked to the jury that convicted him hoping “we may yet hereafter in heaven merrily all meet together, to our everlasting salvation.”

He kissed the executioner, about to dispatch him and said, “Thou will give me this day greater benefit than ever any mortal man can be able to give me.” As Fisher prepared calmly for his execution, he dressed in his finest clothes and told his servant that this was his marriage day, and it behooved him “to dress for the solemnity of the marriage.”

The story offers a dramatic mix of law and theology, and Conrad brings to it the eye of a former federal prosecutor, now a senior federal judge in North Carolina. But he brings also the angle of a serious Catholic, who takes fully seriously the faith that removed from these men the fear of death.

The trials through which More and Fisher passed would not exactly pass a demanding test of “due process of law” in our own time. But Conrad leads us through the thicket. More and Fisher refused to take the oaths confirming Henry’s divorce, or the Act of Supremacy, establishing Henry as the Supreme Head of what was now the Church of “England.”

More and Fisher fell back on the understanding in the law that silence implies consent. They made a claim to “conscience” as a way of showing the want of “malice” that was necessary to the crime. But silence, of course, would not do, and so the next statute took the refusal to take the oath as the “misprision of a felony.”

That notion of “conscience” has been the parent of serious confusion in this story. The most famous account of More has come through Robert Bolt’s play, turned into a movie, A Man for All Seasons. But as Gunnar Gundersen pointed out in these columns, Bolt gave us a More furnished with the “clichés” of our own day.

Bolt has More say that what matters to him is not that “I believe” these arguments to be true, but that “I believe” them. In the vernacular of our day, Bolt sought to show that the lodestar for More was to be comfortable with himself.

That stands in striking contrast to John Paul II’s teaching that “conscience” is directed to an objective set of moral norms outside ourselves. And as Robert Conrad shows, that is the only account of More that makes sense.

For Bolt, the key to More was the “possession of self” – that More was a “hero of selfhood.” To take that path, as John Paul II said, was to move to a “subjectivist” understanding, and in that way “the inescapable truths disappear.” Conrad caught the core of the matter:

\[More and Fisher\] were not adamantine followers of self-will but servants of the one true God who spoke through his Word and his Church. Their shared conviction was that. . .God was truth, and that his Church was a truth-telling institution.”

And that, as Conrad says, was truly a “message for all seasons,” and a script “for generations unborn.”

&lt;p&gt;SS. Bishop John Fisher and Thomas More&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remarkable John Fisher entered Cambridge at the age of 14; he was ordained a priest in 1491 at the age of 22; and ten years later he became vice-chancellor, rising to chancellor of his beloved university in 1504. The same year, he was named the Bishop of Rochester.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He would be confessor to the mother of King Henry VII, and possibly also a tutor to the prince who would become Henry VIII – and order Fisher’s execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Henry sought to end his marriage with his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, a hearing was held at the Legatine Court. Bishop Fisher served as counsel to the queen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Catherine stood on her own to make her case, it was simple, powerful – and affecting. She had borne Henry’s children, including three sons who had died; she asserted that at the time of their marriage, “I was a true maid without touch of man.” And finally, she reminded Henry that the pope had issued a bull confirming her marriage to be valid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even a gathering of tamed bishops could be chastened. Nevertheless, the fix was in. Henry declared that the bishops unanimously accepted his case, and the Archbishop of Canterbury chimed in that “all my brethren here present will affirm the same.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the moment was quickly broken when Bishop Fisher said, with firmness, “No sir, not I. You have not my consent thereto.” And that set him on the course leading to his execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, the King tried to have Fisher poisoned, but he had forgotten that Fisher was ascetic. Fisher ate nothing, but his servant, cleaning up, died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fisher and his soulmate, the Sainted Thomas More sought to preserve a civil deference to the king even as they refused to take an oath that Henry was now the Supreme head of the Church in England. The Succession Act would dissolve in a stroke the claim of Rome to authority over priests and churches, and the dutiful attachment of the faithful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a long, distinguished career in law, diplomacy, and the repressing of heretics, More had risen to become Lord Chancellor. He had become along the way an intimate of Henry’s; still he could remark, with an unshakeable sobriety, that “if my head would win [Henry] a castle in France, it should not fail to go.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the legends of Thomas More so much has been heard, but far less attention has been given to Fisher. And yet Fisher’s story reveals a record of courage and conviction not any shade less than that of More’s. For they shared the same depth of faith that alone could explain why both men were able to move so cheerily to their deaths – and sainthood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that story is recalled now and linked, in the most telling way, to the story of More, with Robert Conrad’s new book (forthcoming from St. Benedict Press), John Fisher and Thomas More: Keeping Their Souls While Losing Their Heads. More remarked to the jury that convicted him hoping “we may yet hereafter in heaven merrily all meet together, to our everlasting salvation.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He kissed the executioner, about to dispatch him and said, “Thou will give me this day greater benefit than ever any mortal man can be able to give me.” As Fisher prepared calmly for his execution, he dressed in his finest clothes and told his servant that this was his marriage day, and it behooved him “to dress for the solemnity of the marriage.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story offers a dramatic mix of law and theology, and Conrad brings to it the eye of a former federal prosecutor, now a senior federal judge in North Carolina. But he brings also the angle of a serious Catholic, who takes fully seriously the faith that removed from these men the fear of death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trials through which More and Fisher passed would not exactly pass a demanding test of “due process of law” in our own time. But Conrad leads us through the thicket. More and Fisher refused to take the oaths confirming Henry’s divorce, or the Act of Supremacy, establishing Henry as the Supreme Head of what was now the Church of “England.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and Fisher fell back on the understanding in the law that silence implies consent. They made a claim to “conscience” as a way of showing the want of “malice” that was necessary to the crime. But silence, of course, would not do, and so the next statute took the refusal to take the oath as the “misprision of a felony.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That notion of “conscience” has been the parent of serious confusion in this story. The most famous account of More has come through Robert Bolt’s play, turned into a movie, A Man for All Seasons. But as Gunnar Gundersen pointed out in these columns, Bolt gave us a More furnished with the “clichés” of our own day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bolt has More say that what matters to him is not that “I believe” these arguments to be true, but that “I believe” them. In the vernacular of our day, Bolt sought to show that the lodestar for More was to be comfortable with himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that, as Conrad says, was truly a “message for all seasons,” and a script “for generations unborn.”&lt;/p&gt;

I think it's a great reminder to be conscious of who's positive opinions and approval we fear losing.

For many of us (including myself), I just want to be liked. And when somebody goes out of their way to let me know they don't approve of me, I feel bad.

That is until I start to analyze what kind of person they are. How do they treat people? How do they talk to people? What kinds of people *do* they approve of? And what kind of person would I have to be to gain their approval?

It's only then that I find closure and comfort and come to terms with the fact that I don't really want their approval.

If we pay attention I think our need for validation is a general thing. We really don't think about who we want to validate us, we just want the validation. But the who matters because it will determine how we think of ourselves, and then how we behave in life.

For example, I don't want the approval of self-absorbed people who think money and nice things are all that matter in life. So when somebody who thinks that way disapproves of me, it's a lot easier to shrug it off. I wasn't ever going to get your approval anyway because I don't value the things you value. So when you make it clear that I don't have your approval, I wasn't expecting it so I don't feel as if anything was taken away from me.

This helps keep me focused on who I do want to be like. How do they think? How do they treat others? What do they value? I don't want to get dependent on gaining their approval, but if I know what admire what they approve of then it's a lot easier for me to focus on following what they do.

Otherwise you end up following people you don't even like, just because you think you need them to like you.

I don't WANT crowd approval. Especially when the crowd in question is so clearly lacking in love.

And when it all comes down to it:

St. Joseph: Our Patron Saint of a Happy &amp; Holy Death

Intriguing, hidden, and silent, St. Joseph’s role in salvific history has been analyzed and philosophized for millennia. Also known as Terror of Demons, Light of Patriarchs, and Mirror of Patience, St. Joseph remains a powerful intercessor for many. Often invoked by those desperate to find gainful employment or patrons who find it impossible to sell their homes, St. Joseph can be much more for us—a friend, a mentor.

His silence reminds us to listen more, to allow God to move in us instead of reacting impulsively, to quiet our emotions before offering a wise answer, and to walk humbly each day in our spiritual journey.

This humility, when we seek to imitate it as St. Joseph surely did, becomes a hallmark to a happy death. His exemplary virtue brings us back from confusion, discord, and the restlessness we often find ourselves wallowing in. Here are some ways we can invoke his prayers and guidance as we face the end of our days on earth.

St. Joseph Waited for God’s Guidance and Promptly Followed It

Consider the Flight to Egypt: Mary slept soundly next to St. Joseph, cradling the Infant Jesus in her arms. It was night, and silence enveloped them. Suddenly, St. Joseph was started awake by a dream, in which St. Gabriel announced an urgent message: “Take the child immediately to Egypt!”

It had been a long stretch of their sojourn to Bethlehem. The Holy Family knew during that time that they, even as pilgrims, could not rush God’s plan for them. So they waited for direction and never questioned the inopportune moment of quietly slipping away into the night.

When we ponder our mortality, we tend to bypass it out of fear. We can pray to St. Joseph to help us wait patiently through our earthly sufferings and to offer them back to God in reparation for our sins. This is the slow road to sanctity.

How hasty am I to find answers to my questions or prayers? How can St. Joseph help me to wait patiently for God’s perfect timing?

St. Joseph Was Devoted to Mary and Jesus.

Imitation of St. Joseph’s fidelity to Our Lady and Jesus is a sure path to Heaven for us. When our hearts are fixed on eternity, it is not difficult to imagine the end of our earthly existence. Those who are tormented terribly in their final days would do well to receive the consolation from saints and angels.

Our Lady has promised those who love her and are faithful to her Son will not be neglected at the hour of death. St. Joseph remained at their side and cared for them, even as he grew infirm and aged.

When we age, too, we might forget about Heaven, because pain distracts us from prayer and suffering with patience. Let us ask St. Joseph, then, to come to our aid as our bodies and minds begin to fail us, that we remain faithful to God.

In what ways can I ask St. Joseph to increase my devotion to the United Hearts of Jesus and Mary?

St. Joseph Was Patient, Meek, Prudent, and Pure

St. Joseph was patient – He never made decisions without clear direction from God. Even as God gave him signs in dreams and visions, he did not doubt God’s voice. Patience stems from a keen awareness of the presence of the Holy Spirit in and around us. Let us pay attention to the subtle cues from God every day.

St. Joseph was meek – He was receptive, sensitive, and vulnerable. Through these qualities, he exhibited emotional strength and spiritual stamina. We often equate meekness with weakness of spirit, but there is a reason it is mentioned in the Beatitudes. A heart that is closed to love is one that is not meek, but it takes radical trust to expose oneself entirely to the unknown.

St. Joseph was prudent – He took time to deliberate before making a decision that would affect not only his immediate family, but all of us! I wonder if he knew the weight of his authority, if he understood the implications of keeping Jesus safe so that He could save souls to the end of time?

St. Joseph was pure – This includes chastity and modesty, yes, but also purity of heart. Those who are pure of heart are unpretentious and empty of self. This allows room for the Holy Spirit to work in them. Emptiness of self is likely one of the most difficult poverties we will face as we age and face death, but St. Joseph can be the beacon to direct us Heavenward.

How can I model St. Joseph in patience, meekness, prudence, and purity?

Death can be terrifying, but it has the potential to be beautiful, too. It can leave us feeling unsettled, or we can be immersed in the peace that surpasses all human understanding. We have the power to choose how we will live today – for ourselves or for God? The road to a holy death is paved with countless crossroads and is covered in fog.

St. Joseph, Patron of a Happy Death, pray for us!

We have the power to choose how we will live today – for ourselves or for God? The road to a holy death is paved with countless crossroads and is covered in fog.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;St. Joseph, Patron of a Happy Death, pray for us!&lt;/p&gt;

If a book is stopping you from doing something wrong you need to look at your values. It can be said for any wrong thing. It should not be a book that stops you , it should be your own values. Yes , obviously evolution has a play in morals. Why would we want to kill our baby/parents our hurt it. How does that help us. It doesn't. We have evolution within us we are meant to evolve. We aren't meant to devolve and just turn into crap. And if you wanna talk about morals in the Bible there is so many immoral stuff in the Bible it isn't even funny.

You have to come to terms with the pain, and break free of your addiction cycle.  Because I am certain that even at the moment of death, if they repented and begged God’s forgiveness, for Jesus’s forgiveness, it would be granted. 

Jesus also says ask and ye shall receive, so ask him to help you, ask him to lift you out of your addictions, and ask him to take care of your love, and to ensure she is with him in the kingdom. 

Don’t give into despair, call someone who can help you when the urge to plummet into the addiction strikes you.

261,,Christianity,"I have almost, lost my faith. I try to follow Jesus from fear in order to get saved if in case He is real. But deep in my heart I do not believe so much. Why I should believe that the Bible is the word or God? 

There are other religions/traditions too. Why I should consider them as false but accept Christianity? If it cant be proved that the Bible is really the word of God then,it is natural for me to lose faith etc etc.

Also, some people said that they are Christians because to them Christianity made sense or something like that. To me some things in Christianity do not make sense. For example, why would God create us and give us free will but also, have some rules in order to get to heaven. I am not talking about being good person etc.

 I am talking about other rules (according to some priests) like no sex before marriage, going to church every time, fasting in Wednesday and Friday (orthodoxy), having faith. Some people maybe be good people but agnostic. Do those really deserve hell? Why would God send an honest agnostic to be tormented in hell for eternity?

Also, I have been told that we all deserve hell and Jesus is the savor. Why we all deserve hell? Is it our nature? if it is our nature then its not our fault. Since some Christians say that to them Christianity make sense, then, its natural for me to say that some things in CHristianity or at least how the churches present them, do not make sense.

 Do I deserve hell for losing my faith or feeling like an agnostic? Of course I try to follow Jesus, just in case He is real, but I cant be ""Jesus is real 100%"" I have heard opinions from Christians and agnostics.

This is not what Jesus says that we have to do in order to obtain salvation. Salvation is by grace alone through faith alone in Christ's finished work on the cross alone (Ephesians 2:8-9). Jesus wants a relationship with you, but you must first put your trust in what he says that he did for you on the cross (Philippians 2:4-11). As you walk with the Lord by spending time talking with him and reading his word, your faith will increase. You can also ask God to help your unbelief - ask this in Jesus's name.

&gt;Titus 3:4-7

&gt;""But when the kindness and love of God our Savior appeared, he saved us, not because of righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He saved us through the washing of rebirth and renewal by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us generously through Jesus Christ our Savior, so that, having been justified by his grace, we might become heirs having the hope of eternal life.""

When he delivered the last order that day, he was attacked by three men, severely beaten and robbed. And one of them even stabbed him. The wound was fatal, so he died very soon. He turned out to be a 24 year old Trey Alexander Relford and two of his companions. And here comes the final hearing. The hearing was attended by the murderer and by the victim’s dad - Abdul-Munim Sombat Jitmoud.

Being on the witness stand, Sombat Jitmund claimed that ""Forgiveness is the greatest gift"". He addressed Relford directly and said, “I’m not angry at you.“I’m angry at the devil,\`\`''I blame the devil, who misguided you to do such a horrible crime.” He continued: “I forgive you on behalf of Salahuddin and his mother.” 

After Jitmoud gave his statement, the Judge wiped a tear and called for a break in the hearing.

When court resumed, Relford apologized to Jitmoud for his son’s death. “I’m sorry about what happened that day,” Relford said, wiping his eyes on the collar of his orange jail uniform. “I do applaud you because it takes a powerful man to know that someone has hurt them and to get up there and say what you just said. I can’t imagine the hurt, the pain. There’s nothing I can do ... I thank you for your forgiveness.”

Sombat Jitmoud stood, took a step or two toward Relford, and extended his hand offering a tissue. Then the two of them shook hands AND hugged each other.

Also remember that God has promised to work everything for the good of those who love Him.

How or why do we love Him? It is the work of the Holy Spirit within us who creates, maintains, and strengthens our faith through His Word and sacraments.

As Christians we know that God always keeps His promises.

I suggest studying the doctrine of vocation. What is your vocation? It is not just a single thing.

The question seems to be if the SBC patriarchs are going to double down on their inflexibility.","roger e olson:

...

&gt; Although I have never been SBC, I have observed it from afar and close up. My observation is that the SBC is by-and-large, with many exceptions, sectarian in its ethos—virtually ignoring other Christians and holding an attitude of being spiritually superior—even to other evangelical Baptist denominations and churches. And, during the last twenty-five to thirty years, the SBC has gone through a radical transformation toward fundamentalism.

...


&gt; The two issues that seem to have become obsessions with SBC conservatives, who took over the denomination in the 1970s through the 1990s, are biblical inerrancy, the definition of which even they cannot agree about, and women in ministry, the details of which even they cannot agree about. SBC seminary professors who would not espouse biblical inerrancy and who believed in women in ministry were purged from those seminaries.

&gt; The SBC was founded in the 1840s by Baptist slave owners and defenders of slavery in the South. To be sure, the SBC later (over a century later) publicly apologized for that, but now the presidents of the SBC seminaries have publicly denounced critical race theory without consulting their own African-American mega-church pastors at least two of which (in Texas) are publicly leaving the SBC over this.

&gt; I am proud to say I have never been a Southern Baptist. And when I search for a new church to attend after retirement, after I move to a major American metropolitan area, I will not even consider one of the many SBC churches there.

&gt; So to Beth Moore I say “Congratulations!” and “Welcome” to the non-SBC evangelical world. You are better off without the SBC.",,,,,https://www.patheos.com/blogs/rogereolson/2021/03/congratulations-to-beth-moore-on-leaving-the-southern-baptist-convention/,

Israel will never be destroyed and Christians wouldn’t want that anyway.  Israel plays a significantly huge part of the church age and end time events.  The old covenant pointed towards what was to come, which was the messiah Jesus Christ.","I can't speak for Catholics, as you cite those Popes, and as Catholics uphold unbiblical doctrines, but as a Christian I'll say that the New Testament is the fulfillment of the Old Testament. What God had promised the Jews through the prophets, and as far back as Adam ([Gen 3:15](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A15&amp;version=NASB)), He gave to them through Jesus, in the First Coming of the Messiah: [Zechariah 14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+14&amp;version=NASB) tells us that God Himself shall sit on the throne, yet [Psalm 2](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+2&amp;version=NASB) states that He shall be a descendant of David, and [Isaiah 7:14](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+7%3A14&amp;version=NASB) puts forth that He'll be of virgin birth; again, [Zechariah 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+9&amp;version=NASB) predicts a king of peace while Zechariah 14 predicts one of victory; [Micah 5](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Micah+5&amp;version=NASB) speaks of one who shall be born in Bethlehem, but [Daniel 7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+7&amp;version=NASB) speaks of a divine ruler; it is [Daniel 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel+9&amp;version=NASB) that proclaims the Messiah will be cut off, and [Isaiah 9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+9&amp;version=NASB) that says He'll reign forever. [Isaiah 53:8-9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah+53%3A8-9&amp;version=NASB) speaks of a suffering servant, who has come to atone for our sins in His death, and the same is said in [Zec 12:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Zechariah+12%3A10&amp;version=NASB) and [Psalm 22](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+22&amp;version=NASB).

The First Coming has occurred, and now we're in the Age of the Church in the time before the Second Coming, when all unatoned sin will be conquered and judged, and the earthly kingdom will finally be established ([Mat 25:31-46](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+25%3A31-46&amp;version=NASB), [Rev 19:11-16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation+19%3A11-16&amp;version=NASB)) — at the moment, the Messiah is as David said He would be in [Psalm 110](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm%20110&amp;version=NASB), saying, ""The Lord says to my Lord: 'Sit at My right hand until I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet ([Acts 1:11](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+1%3A11&amp;version=NASB)).'""

Having said all of this, I'll repeat again that the New Testament is a fulfillment of the Old Testament, and this is what Jesus said in [Matthew 5:17](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%205:17&amp;version=NASB); He didn't come to abolish but to fulfill it. The sacrificial lambs of the Old Testament all were to point to this eventual sinless Lamb of God, who's the only sacrifice that can ever actually wash away sin. As it is said in [Genesis 15:6](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2015%3A6&amp;version=NASB), these sacrifices of the Old Testament never saved anybody — if you're not in Christ, you're not saved ([Acts 4:12](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts%204%3A12&amp;version=NASB)).

[First John 5:10](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20John%205%3A10&amp;version=NASB) asserts that those who deny the Son also deny God, for the Son is from God, and those who reject the Son reject what God has said of His Son. This is one reason why Judaism isn't an equal path to God; of course, the Jews are the literal genealogical descendants of Abraham, with whom the covenant was made, but in [Matthew 3:9](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew%203:9&amp;version=NASB) Jesus said, ""I tell you that God is able, from these stones, to raise up children for Abraham."" More importantly, in [John 8:32-41](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+8%3A32-41&amp;version=NASB) He said, and I only take an excerpt here, ""If you are Abraham’s children, do the deeds of Abraham. But as it is, you are seeking to kill Me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God; this Abraham did not do.""

I don't mean any ill-will towards you as a Jew, for we've all been complicit in the crucifixion of Christ as a result of our sin (a Christian as much as anyone else), and God commands us to love our neighbor, but I'm just answering this biblically in hopes for your salvation. The Apostle Paul called himself the Jew of Jews, for he was a Pharisee, a member of the Sanhedrin, a member of the tribe of Benjamin, and a man circumcised on the eighth day, yet he repeated the words of Jesus in [Romans 9:6-7](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Rom%209:6-7&amp;version=NASB&amp;src=tools): ""For they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel; nor are they all children because they are Abraham’s descendants.""

In the same manner he spoke in [Romans 2:25-29](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans%202:25-29&amp;version=NASB), saying, ""He is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh. But he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter; and his praise is not from people, but from God."" The Messiah did come out of Israel, as God promised Abraham, but not all who descend from Israel are children because of their genealogy. Ill wrap this up by quoting Paul in [Galatians 3:28](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Galatians%203%3A28&amp;version=NASB), where he said, ""There is neither Jew nor Greek \[...\] for you are all one in Christ Jesus.""

I hope this helps provide an answer to your question in some way. God bless.","Here’s from The New International Greek Testament Commentary:

Hebrews 8:13 (Hebrews (NIGTC)): 8:13. God’s declaration of a new covenant makes the first covenant old
This verse consists of a specific comment on v. 8d (Je. 31[﻿LXX﻿ 38]:31c), which is made the basis of a general statement (cf. 2:8). Both halves of the verse contain a formal element: (a) to call one covenant new is automatically to define the other as old; (b) old age is a sign that death and dissolution are near.
This is certainly part of the meaning; yet if it were all, (a) would be a virtual tautology, (b) would be trite, and the whole verse would be inadequate as a comment on so extensive a quotation. The meaning is strengthened when due weight is given to the fact that the subject of πεπαλαίωκεν is not generally “someone,” or even “scripture,” but “God,” as in → v. 8a. The new covenant is not only or mainly a question of definition, or an exegetical conclusion based on a proof-text in Jeremiah; the new covenant is a new act of God, to which scripture bears witness.
The function of this verse, and of the preceding quotation, can thus best be seen in the light of the following argument. The author reserves further comment at this stage because, although the Jeremiah passage is not directly christological, and the author does not interpret it christologically, its full significance can only be seen in the light of Christ’s sacrifice, which forms the substance of the new covenant. The negative statements of vv. 7–13 have yet to receive a positive complement by reference to the work of Christ (9:11–14). It is only after this has been done that the author can speak explicitly of Christ’s relation to the new covenant (9:15). See Vanhoye 143f.; 1980.205.
The present verse presupposes the rabbinic principle that a new act of God supersedes the old; a principle which underlies the argument in 4:8; 7:11, 28; 10:2, and is found also in Philo, Rer. Div. Her. 178. There is indirect evidence that the application of this principle to the new covenant was part of a tradition represented both in the NT and at Qumran. Hab. 1:5 was applied at Qumran to the new covenant (1QpHab 1:5), and the same text is cited in Acts 13:41 in a passage which has many points of contact with Hebrews (Acts 13:33 = Ps. 2:7 = Heb. 1:5; 5:5; in Acts 13:38, the forgiveness (ἄφεσις) of sins (cf. Heb. 10:18) is contrasted with the inefficacy of the old dispensation; ἀφανισμός in Heb. 8:13 recalls ἀφανίσθητε in Hab. 1:5b = Acts 13:41b). See Weber 109; Schröger 145, 258, 302; cf. B. Bat.8.5f., 135b.
The language of this verse is sufficiently general to leave open the question whether the author thought of the first covenant as old and moribund already from the time of Jeremiah’s declaration, or only from the time of Christ’s coming and/or death. General considerations suggest that the author was more concerned with the time in which he and his readers were living. Statements about the supersession of the old dispensation appear to grow generally bolder as the argument progresses (cf. 7:18f.; 10:9, 18); yet the continued existence of the first covenant is never completely denied.
Ἐν τῷ λέγειν is a Hebraism (be + infinitive) which extends to biblical but not to spoken Aramaic (﻿BD﻿ §404[3]; ﻿MHT﻿ 2.450). The meaning of the construction is usually temporal (→ 2:15), but here, as in 2:8b; 3:15, the context suggests an instrumental meaning (“by speaking,” ﻿NJB﻿, ﻿TEV﻿, ﻿REB﻿; ﻿NIV﻿ “by calling this covenant ‘new’ ”).
Πεπαλαίωκεν: → 1:11. In the present verse, the active voice means “declare old” (cf. the forensic sense of δικαιόω = “declare righteous”). The perfect is used typically of the permanent effect of God’s speaking, especially as recorded in scripture (→ 2:13, εἴρηκεν).
Δέ (KJV “now,” most modern translations “and”) is not contrastive, but marks the transition from the specific to the general statement.
Γηράσκω (Jn. 21:18﻿**﻿) in the ﻿LXX﻿ generally refers to people, and occasionally other living beings (Jb. 14:8 of a tree), growing old (﻿e.g.﻿, Gn. 18:13; 24:36).
Ἀφανισμός**﻿ is frequent in the ﻿LXX﻿, especially in Jeremiah. It is often used as an equivalent or euphemism for desolation or laying waste. Here, however, nothing in the context suggests violence of this kind, and the collocation with γηράσκον (“draws to its natural end,” Westcott) rather suggests the weaker meaning “disappearance” (so most translations). For the whole of v. 13b, Riggenbach aptly refers to Plut. ﻿Conv. Disp.﻿ 7.3.4 (702c), τὸ δὲ οὐκ ἔχον διαπνοὴν … ταχὺ παλαιοῦται καὶ ἀπογηράσκει.
Ἐγγύς: → 6:8﻿*﻿, also in a negative context. The statement falls short of saying that the old cultus has already disappeared; but in any case, the author is concerned with the witness of scripture rather than with contemporary events. So H. Seesemann in ﻿TDNT﻿ 5.720.",,,,,,

Consider 1 John 1:8 (ESV)

&gt; If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.

From [The Lutheran Study Bible](http://www.cph.org/t-tlsb.aspx)

&gt; 1:8 Sin is not only what we do against God’s commands in thought, word, and deed, but is also what we do naturally from the moment of our conception (cf Ps 51:5). Jesus taught that man’s corrupted nature is incapable of doing any good (cf Jn 6:63; 15:5). Luth: “Although we have become a new creature, nevertheless the remnants of sin always remain in us. We still have sin, and the poison is still in us; and that sin incites us to the fruits of sin, as in the case of David, to whom inherent, encompassing, and indwelling sin said: ‘Slay Uriah’ (cf. 2 Sam. 11:15). David consented and sinned. . . . Although we are Christians sprinkled with the blood of Christ, yet we often err. Therefore the true knowledge of Christ causes a person to feel that he has sin. Furthermore, it causes us to lament this. . . . Finally we should hold most firmly to this, that no one is or becomes righteous before God except through the blood of Jesus Christ. For God alone is righteous, truthful, and wise. Whatever we do out of faith, we should always say: ‘It is sin’ and ‘We are unworthy servants,’ Luke 17:10. But we gain salvation solely because of the righteousness of God, and it is because of this righteousness that we are saved” (AE 30:229).

We sin with every thought, word, and deed.

In Romans 7:14-20, Paul tells us that not even he, an Apostle, is free from the grasp of sin. If there was no hope for him, what possible hope is there for us?

&gt; (ESV)
&gt; For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin. For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate. Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good. So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me. For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out. For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing. Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.

Also consider 1 Tim 1:15 (ESV)

&gt; the saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.

Our very nature is turned against God.

As Christians we do not make excuses for our sin. We do not declare what is sin as not sin or not serious. We acknowledge our sin and repent, knowing that God has forgiven our sin. He has provided that forgiveness of sin by what He accomplished on the cross through the suffering, death, and resurrection of Christ. The righteousness of Christ has been imputed to us. He has promised to deliver His promises to us freely through His Word and sacraments. 

I suggest studying the doctrine of [Original Sin](http://cyclopedia.lcms.org/display.asp?t1=S&amp;word=SIN.ORIGINAL)

There are several good issues, etc. segments on the doctrine of original sin.

[Forgiveness](https://preview.redd.it/gbrzj1jeigm61.jpg?width=2000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=be0adc4439b9a66b11788a50e76e4aeb9a1df8f3)

Forgiveness

Brothers and sisters:

None of us lives for oneself, and no one dies for oneself. (Rom 14:7)

Unforgiveness in our heart is akin to a big sign that says, “demons welcome”. Life trauma can make it very difficult to forgive\[i\]. Yet St. Paul’s wisdom challenges us to think about being other-centered, and Lent is the time to develop this. As Christians sincerely wanting to follow Jesus, we try to be cognizant of the needs of others. Yet our own neediness remains in the background begging attention, and this neediness quite often comes from our woundedness. To live and to die for Jesus is to live and to die for others, even those who are difficult to forgive. As Deacon Paternostro aptly puts it:

“Grudges are satisfying while we are thinking about them, but they leave a horrible aftertaste. As we nurse them, we are able to think of all the ways we are right and superior. When we are done thinking over the offending scenario, however, we are simply left with frustration and anger that we only want to be rid of. The problem is that we think of how right we are in the moment, and we relish that feeling for as long as it lasts—until the crash afterwards. It is the paradox that Sirach identifies in the first reading today: “Wrath and anger are hateful things, yet the sinner hugs them tight” (Sir. 27:30). We despise what we are holding onto, but cannot resist holding onto it.” … “Our very salvation is at stake if we don’t let go of our anger.”

This is the key to forgiveness. We must first desire to truly forgive the other person (and not just because others expect us to!). Since all desire comes from God, we must ask for this first until we have let Him fill us with sincerity. He has given us in our own nature the ability to do so intellectually. So, with His actual Grace, we reach some tranquility, some level of forgiving the other person.

That is, until we actually must spend time with them again, and then something triggers the pain. What is forgiveness if it’s so quick to fade away?

“So will my heavenly Father do to you, unless each of you forgives his brother from his heart.” (MT 18:35)

True and full forgiveness comes from the heart, and we aren’t capable of that on our own. Forgiveness isn’t an act in itself. It is an outcome of love in action. And we cannot manufacture love, only God can. So, we must ask Him for the love needed for the other person, and out of that love will come our ability to forgive. In this way, forgiveness moves from the head to the heart, as only the Holy Spirit can do.

“God speaks in the silence of the heart, and we listen.

And then we speak to God from the fullness of our heart, and God listens.

And this listening and this speaking is what prayer is meant to be….” -  (Mother Teresa)

But here’s the catch: there must be room in your heart for the Love to forgive. And that takes healing. It requires time in silent mental prayer going with God into the places you’d rather not go. The Holy Spirit who teaches us to pray will reveal to you what is holding you back from forgiving, and in this time alone with God you can profess it to Him, the one who already knows this is in your heart and is waiting for you with open arms. This surrendering and emptying to God provides the space for Grace, and He will lavish you with love overflowing to the extent of your surrender. So don’t hold back!

“Lord, if my brother sins against me, how often must I forgive?

As many as seven times?”

Jesus answered, “I say to you, not seven times but seventy times seven.” - (MT 18:21-22)

Forgiveness, then, isn’t an act or an action. It is a process, and is ongoing for two reasons: (1) God’s love is infinite and so we can never have enough love for the other person; we must always ask for more; and (2) if we step out of the process, we risk stepping out of love for them.

We can see that the process of forgiveness is one of healing, and what is healing if not sanctification?

Which brings up the sacraments, through which healing comes into full fruition. Recalling that God won’t force His love on us because, well, that would be unloving and controlling, He waits for us in the sacraments. As with the saints before him and since, St. Ignatius of Loyola often directed that mass and confession will aid whatever situation was at hand. Continue then to pray for Pope Francis, all clergy and those on the path, our religious and worldwide Church.

Mary, Mother of Jesus, throw your mantle of purity over our priests.

Protect them, guide them, and keep them in your heart.

Be a Mother to them, especially in times of discouragement and loneliness.

Love them and keep them belonging completely to Jesus.

Like Jesus, they, too, are your sons, so keep their hearts pure and virginal.

Keep their minds filled with Jesus, and put Jesus always on their lips, so that he is the one they offer to sinner and to all they meet.

Mary, Mother of Jesus, be their Mother, loving them and bringing them joy.

Take special care of sick and dying priests, and the ones most tempted.

Remember how they spent their youth and old age, their entire lives serving and giving all to Jesus.

Mary, bless them and keep a special place for them in your heart.

Give them a piece of your heart, so beautiful and pure and immaculate, so full of love and humility, so that they, too, can grow in the likeness of Christ.

Dear Mary, make them humble like you, and holy like Jesus. Amen. - (by Mother Teresa)

That's not to say that he lacked supernatural access to knowledge, per /u/WeAreTychicus 's comment.  Whether directly or through some charism provided by the Father, He knew things it was impossible for an ordinary human to know.  But it clearly wasn't *omniscience*.","No he didn’t. Despite the condescension of the Son of God to empty Himself and make Himself nothing (Philippians 2:7), His omniscience is clearly seen in the New Testament writings. The first prayer of the apostles in Acts 1:24, “Lord, you know everyone’s heart,” implies Jesus’ omniscience, which is necessary if He is to be able to receive petitions and intercede at God’s right hand. On earth, Jesus’ omniscience is just as clear. In many Gospel accounts, He knew the thoughts of his audience (Matthew 9:4; 12:25; Mark 2:6-8; Luke 6:8). He knew about people’s lives before He had even met them. When He met the woman collecting water at the well at Sychar, He said to her, “The fact is you have had five husbands, and the man you now have is not your husband” (John 4:18). He also tells His disciples that their friend Lazarus was dead, although He was over 25 miles away from Lazarus’s home (John 11:11-15). He advised the disciples to go and make preparation for the Lord’s Supper, describing the person they were to meet and follow (Mark 14:13-15). Perhaps best of all, He knew Nathanael before ever meeting him, for He knew his heart (John 1:47-48).",,,,,,

I don’t know how to solve this problem but i know that I’ll never be able to change and I hate it. So why was I made black. If God knew this, why did he make me ugly&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: Thank you guys for your kind words. I’m working on liking myself but I still question. If God knew I would suffer like this, why was this in his plan?&lt;/p&gt;

If you accept Jesus as lord and saviour you are saved and will go to ""heaven"".  In actuality, heaven will come to earth and we'll be here similar to how Adam and Eve were in the Garden.

The new covenant is the acceptance of Jesus.  Jesus has already paid the price for your sin through his death and He represents the resurrection, the first born that will happen at the end.  When you accept Him (and He is God), you gain the gift of the Holy Spirit who slowly begins to transform you into a more Christ-like being.  Your sins are forgiven at the point of your acceptance.

No politician enters office with the goal of making life worse for their constituents (which, as per our system, is the majority of people). Each pursues the goals of the people they represent, for better or for worse.

The problem is that we don't have a common view of ""good"". Sure, we all connect on a basic level (liberty and justice for all), but when it comes to the finer details of achieving that, there's no consensus. Which wouldn't be so bad in of itself if we weren't so quick to label the opposition as somehow evil.","I would argue politicians and laws ought to work towards protecting your individual rights, as endowed by your Creator (“nature’s God”), and, when a government fails to do so, it is failing in its primary purpose. This is the Lockian philosophy that underlies the Declaration of Independence. 

Whenever a word is added in front of justice, it is no longer justice. Justice is deciding what is good and fair based on the individual’s actions. Social justice is deciding what is good and fair and who is guilty/not guilty based on the actions of your ancestors, which is directly in opposition to the Bible; the son does not carry the sins of his father. Judging an individual based on their membership in a specific social group and not based on their individual actions, thoughts and beliefs is not only unjust, it is not Christian. 

This does not mean that we should not care for others. It simply means you cannot advocate for the modern definition of social justice (basically, treating people differently based on their perceived social group) and be advocating for a Christian approach to the world. I would actually argue that this one of many reasons Christianity and Marxism do not mix; Christianity advocates for salvation through individual choices, decisions, actions and repentance. Marxism relies on deciding who is good and who is evil based on their group status.",,,,,,

Repent about everything you’ve done, and mean it in your heart. And then walk in your new life and let God lead. If we don’t let God lead we will be right back in the same mess.

As for your parents, forgive them, love them the best you can, pray for them, and continue on your walk. Our parents won’t be walking us through judgement..

Continue to pray, and know that love conquers all. This isn’t heaven or hell. It’s like a battle ground where we experience and learn the lessons God would have us learn. 

There will be trials, test, and tribulations tho, so prepare yourself, this isn’t easy... and as soon as you walk against the devil is when things will start to get uncomfortable but praise God!!

(Jesus said to the woman, ""Your faith has saved you; go in peace."") - Luke 7:50

(""There will be weeping there, and **gnashing of teeth**, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.) - Luke 13:28

(God assails me and tears me in his anger and **gnashes his teeth at me**; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.) - Job 16:9

perhaps you are the cause of your suffering

the fire of hell could be metaphorical

(For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in **chains of darkness** to be held for judgment;) - 2 Peter 2:4

or even in the tribulation when God's wrath is being poured out into the world the people aren't sorry or begging for forgiveness

(They were seared by the intense heat and **they cursed the name of God**, who had control over these plagues, but **they refused to repent and glorify him**.) - Revelation 16:9

(and **cursed the God of heaven** because of their pains and their sores, but **they refused to repent of what they had done**.) - Revelation 16:11

As part of this illness, I was returning to an old thought I had that maybe I didn't have a human soul.  Then I think Genesis 1:27 popped into my mind.

I looked, and it was oddly relevant to my state of mind at that time.  Other strange things happened that makes me think maybe God was reaching out to me as I was reaching out to him, and I am thankful I only spent a week in the hospital with a doctor who also prayed with me instead of a month like last time with little spiritual support.

This last time I had asked for a priest, but was told something along the lines that they were backed up.  Having a doctor who prayed with me and at once solved an issue I was having that morning was truly remarkable, in that I didn't necessarily need a priest all I needed was prayer and professional treatment.","lol I just tried thinking of a random verse (Esther 3:27), and it didn’t exist.

I do not say that naz\*sm or fa\*cism (I am censoring words as Reddit filters used to block me just for mentioning these words) is solution. For example, liberalism gives, in my humble opinion, too much freedom. Almost everything is okay and almost everything is allowed. ""So my mind would go: So it's not bad to do drugs?"", ""So actually there are 62 genders, not only man and woman?"", ""So dogs need to have rights too?"", ""So if I do not agree that immigrants should pass strict screening when entering country I am a bad person?"", ""If I think that homosexuality is a disorder, just because I do not think like majority (at least majority in western countries in one of which I live), I am bad person?"", ""Ohhh really, I can do anything even if I have debilitating illness of schizophrenia? (common motive in liberalism: ""YOU CAN DO ANYTHING!"")"" Etc.

Now, I am absolutely fine with many people disagreeing with me, but I am not fine for being forced unto their beliefs. Then what is a difference between nazi\*m and liberalism?

So you can see, it all adds tremendous confusion to my already paranoid and tormented mind. From thinking that maybe I am not a man, but one of other xyz genders, to thinking that actually prostitution is normal and moral thing to do. Heck, Netherlands made business out of it, and I was always taught to treat women with respect and help any person get out of sins and vices and back on right track.

Only saving grace I found to survive in this liberal madness was when I found God. I started reading Bible and gone through Mark and almost done with Matthew. Sometimes I feel guilty, as I should, for not being really person Jesus wants us to be. But I do repent and pray to God to help me change. Bible gives me comfort as it doesn't change ever. In my very chaotic illness it gives me peace. It's almost like lighthouse in the storm. It helps me not to get lost. It doesn't change every few years and it's not some fantasy product of some random (human) author. It's literally God's word. I do understand atheists file it under fantasy books and often compare it to fairy tales. But still, I can't highlight enough how much God &amp; Bible helped me compared to chaotic and paradoxical society we live in and liberal worldview.

I just wonder,  if any of you kind people, have had or have similar experience? Especially if you gone or are going through such illness. That this life where basically everything is allowed and you can be anything and behave however you want actually harmed you and added to your chaos?

Originally, Christianity and Rabbinic Judaism weren't really separate religions, but two movements among others within Second Temple Judaism, which only became truly separate when the Jewish Temple was destroyed in 70 AD and, further, the Jews were banned from Jerusalem after the failure of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 135 AD. The early Christians did not see themselves as a new religion started by Jesus or by the apostles, but as the next and final stage of Judaism after the fall of Adam, the promise to Abraham, the commandments of Moses and the announcements of the prophets... Then at Pentecost, 50 days after the resurrection of Jesus, the Holy Spirit fell upon the apostles and the Church began. So I guess the most correct answer to your question is that Christianity was started by the apostles in chapter 2 of Acts.

2) Well, see above...

3) The Bible is a library of texts of various genres with various purposes. The Torah is the Law or Pentateuch, the 5 books of Moses, the commandments, and is included in every Bible. There are other types of texts, like historical chronicles of God's people, poetic and philosophical texts, prophecies... to which Christians add the acts and teachings of Jesus and the apostles. 

4) The texts themselves traditionally date from the prophet Moses at the earliest to the apostle John at the latest, so about 1500 years worth of texts. But they weren't compiled together as a single collection, the Bible, until the 4th century, and even then different communities in different locations had different lists of texts and therefore different Bibles, even to this day; this article has good information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biblical_canon

5) In the 5th century, a debate erupted over how exactly the divinity and humanity of Jesus relate to each other. Three camps were distinguished and, to this day, are still separated:

- Chalcedonian Christology (Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Protestant): Jesus is of two natures and in two natures, as one person.

- Miaphysite Christology (Oriental Orthodox, which includes the Coptic Orthodox Church): Jesus is of two natures and in one nature, as one person.

- Nestorian Christology (Assyrian Church of the East, also called Chaldean): Jesus is two persons as one appearance.

Nowadays it *seems* that our beliefs aren't all that different after all, and in fact the Eastern Orthodox and the Oriental Orthodox are working toward reunification. 

In the 11th century, the Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholics separated mainly over the issues of how to understand the Trinity (the Catholics say the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father and the Son, the Orthodox say the Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father alone) and what sort of authority the Pope, the Bishop of Rome, has (Catholics say he has universal immediate jurisdiction and the ability to declare dogma infallibly, Orthodox say he has a high place of honor but is otherwise equal to all other bishops). Note that since then some Orthodox have converted to Catholicism - they are the Eastern Catholics.

In the 16th century the Protestants and the Catholics separated, over many issues, but mainly the Protestants wanted to reform Catholicism and get rid of later innovations. Two noticeable differences are that Protestants say we are saved by faith alone (Catholics and Orthodox say we are saved by faith and works) and doctrine and practice must be derived from the Bible alone (while for Catholics and Orthodox it's the Bible and sacred tradition).

Then Protestants themselves became divided in many denominations, because of disagreements on how to interpret the Bible, and to what degree Catholicism/Orthodoxy actually needs to be reformed. Since the Reformation, more Catholics have become Protestants (like the Old Catholic Church) and some Orthodox as well (like the Mar Thoma Syrian Church in India, and the Pentay in Ethiopia).

6) No, Muhammad was a false prophet and the Quran is not relevant to us. But then [we aren't people of the book either.](https://blogs.ancientfaith.com/glory2godforallthings/2014/10/01/bible-become-quran/)","1. It depends on what you mean by Christianity.   If you mean the church,  then no. The church was created and spread by the apostles and disciples.   If you mean the philosophy,  then at first yes.   Jesus traveled around Judea and spread his message.   What he was teaching is the mission and message of Christianity but not the religious part of it. 

2.  At first one could say yes,  but once it extended itself to the gentiles it became something else. 

3. The Bible is a combination of the Torah and new texts which include the oral traditions of Christ's time on earth as well as the story of the early church and pastoral letters from church leaders to other Christians. 

4. Kind of,  the different books and writings existed before that time.   As did other writings that were not included when the different books were gathered into one larger book,  the Bible. 

5.  The same way other religions, even yours has. Due to disagreements over interpretation of what the text means in living out the faith. 

6. That concept as I understand it does not really exist in Christianity.   But it would be answered differently by different Christian denominations.   My denomination, Catholicism,  would say yes.","Hey friend,

&amp;#x200B;

1) No, not realy. Jesus never wrote something down or made great efforts to enlargen his existing fellowship before his death. He gathered a few people arround him, prepared them for the time after his death and told them what it's all about. And then they captured, tortured and killed him. He then meet them one last time, before vanishing to the Lord fathers side. He obviously told all the folks what the good news is, but you know how open average people are about critique of their lifestyle ;)

This is the story his fellowship spread accross the land and this is the story that to this day inspires and touches people so that they become christians - followers of christ. But christ wasn't the spreader like for example Mohammed (PBUH)  was for islam.

2) Yes, it was a jewish sect in the beginning and the very first christians have been former Jews. It is important to keep in mind, that Jesus Christ himself was a Jew from the day he was born to the day he dies. Never did he say: ""I am a christian now"". He was a Jew.

3) Not so much an Update as a continuation. The Torah by itself is no a-historic document, but tells a continuing story that just further continues in Jesus Christ. So less an Update than an add-on ;)

4) The bible has  aloooong story of becomming to be. Some texts are as old as the egyptian culture is and some texts are relativly new and fresh. The bible is a collection of texts and 300 years is a fair estimation of its core becomming to be. If you take the babylonian exile as the turbo-boost of the Torah and the late conzils as realy defining the chanon you can talk about 1000 years for sure. It's iffy :D

5) Well, it's not unlike you know it in Islam. People read the texts and make different deductions from it. DO we follow this mans deduction or the other mans decution? Is this a difference we can accepts within one core group or do we split up?

In the end we are all christians and kinda like each others just as grappling sibblings do. But some differences are so very keen, that we cant just be one. I, as a Lutheran, could never accept the idea that a mere human can tell me what I have to believe in so that I am a good christian. F\*ck that concept. But Roman catholic brothers and sisters hold that idea of a pope dear and I do not wanna disqualify them for that. I'll argue against it, but I wouldnt ever ask their christianity into question over it.

Different it is with Jehovas whiitnesses, which are a non-christian sect and which people in power can, please quote me on that, go fuck themselfs.

6) Yeah, I say so. We are a book religion in the end and we are very sceptical of extra-biblical knowledge beeing sold as biblical. Which doesnt mean that historical context cannot add much to understanding a text.

333,,Christianity,"This is a follow-up to my previous post about moving from Protestantism to RC after my friend's death a few months ago.

Since a lot of my Catholic friends, classmates, and relatives had taught me great things about Jesus and gave me so much inspiration but my parents will not allow me to convert, I decided to lean more towards Roman Catholicism when my friend died when I was away from my parents. So, at school, (I think it's safe to say that) I am a Roman Catholic.

At school, many people think I am really, really cute. That's why I always go to school with a heart sticker on my hair, although I am a boy.

But I guess not ALL of the students were for Catholicism, though. Earlier today at school, during the break between period 3 and 4 I felt very desperate to pee. I quickly ran to the boys' restroom, and there were a bunch of boys heading their eyes towards me. 

One of them asked me, ""Are you a Catholic or a Christian?"" That's when I responded, ""Are you a human or a person, dude? Catholics ARE Christians."" Then another guy said, ""Hey, you cutie pie. Roman Catholics are NOT Christians. You shouldn't have half-converted yourself."" Some other student then said, ""Yeah. Catholics worship Mary. They are heretics! Dirty, dirty heretics! He is turning himself from a cute Christian to a Mary-worshipping HERETIC!""

Those guys started laughing really hard. I was, indeed, offended. But I have ignored them (since I was no longer able to hold it in) and quickly ran into a toilet stall and locked myself. I then sat down on the toilet (instead of standing in front of it) and started peeing peacefully. But the other boys started to resume calling out that I am a non-Christian who worships Mary and I am a heretic. One of them started knocking on the stall door (while I was still in mid-stream) and yelled out loudly, ""YOU WORSHIP MARY!!!"" 

I responded, ""Will you please listen? I do NOT worship Mary!"" But the boys would not stop, so I ended up chasing them through the long, vast hallways.

&lt;p&gt;But I guess not ALL of the students were for Catholicism, though. Earlier today at school, during the break between period 3 and 4 I felt very desperate to pee. I quickly ran to the boys&amp;#39; restroom, and there were a bunch of boys heading their eyes towards me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of them asked me, &amp;quot;Are you a Catholic or a Christian?&amp;quot; That&amp;#39;s when I responded, &amp;quot;Are you a human or a person, dude? Catholics ARE Christians.&amp;quot; Then another guy said, &amp;quot;Hey, you cutie pie. Roman Catholics are NOT Christians. You shouldn&amp;#39;t have half-converted yourself.&amp;quot; Some other student then said, &amp;quot;Yeah. Catholics worship Mary. They are heretics! Dirty, dirty heretics! He is turning himself from a cute Christian to a Mary-worshipping HERETIC!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those guys started laughing really hard. I was, indeed, offended. But I have ignored them (since I was no longer able to hold it in) and quickly ran into a toilet stall and locked myself. I then sat down on the toilet (instead of standing in front of it) and started peeing peacefully. But the other boys started to resume calling out that I am a non-Christian who worships Mary and I am a heretic. One of them started knocking on the stall door (while I was still in mid-stream) and yelled out loudly, &amp;quot;YOU WORSHIP MARY!!!&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I responded, &amp;quot;Will you please listen? I do NOT worship Mary!&amp;quot; But the boys would not stop, so I ended up chasing them through the long, vast hallways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I still desire to fully convert, no matter WHAT.&lt;/p&gt;

I suggest you read them, but to put it in the shortest way possible: the devil is a fallen angel, who out of pride refuses to serve men but instead seeks to make them fall. As a result he will be eternally punished by God, together with the other fallen angels and men who follow him. The devil does not punish people, although being in his presence will be part of the punishment for men. Rather, the devil is stubbornly unrepentant and will be punished by God, and seeks to drag us down with himself. Having said this, the Bible isn't too clear on how many ""devil"" figures there are, nor on whether demons are the fallen angels or something more complex, but you can read the articles if you want to learn about that.

This being said, while the devil and the other malicious angels are unquestionably our enemies in Christianity, in Judaism they're just servants of God doing the dirty work. Why the difference? Well, see the articles...",dc32774e-27d6-11e5-b6e8-0e5e20c89e15,,,,,

I really think you would be happier with someone who is more conformative like you and more modernized.maybe that's not a bad thing for you, but it's a bad thing for me and I don't want to be modernized and I don't want to conform to the ways of this world. I do not think that this relationship can be mended because I am 100% sure that I will not trust you again. I don't know how many times you have lied to me, but I know for sure I told you the last time that you lied to me that if it happened again I would not trust you again. I keep making the mistake of forgiving you and trusting you, and your family has too and that's why they don't trust you anymore. I don't want to hurt your feelings but I need to speak my truth,  but I believe you may be sociopathic because sociopathic people continue to hurt others to either gain something or to deceive people so that they can get away with things they know are wrong but just don't care about. sociopathic people continue to lie because they simply just don't feel bad about it. it scares me to believe that you could possibly be a sociopath, but at this point it is the only logical explanation for why you keep lying to me I know that you love the lord, but for some reason that love and even the love you have for your son is not enough to convict you to make better decisions and to do the right thing. a drug addict has relapses and that's normal. but lying to your spouse or especially your family, for your whole life is not okay and it should never be normal. as that verse in the Bible says when I was a child, I thought like a child in reasons like a child, and when I became a man I left my childish ways behind ... you have been lying to everyone in your entire life, for your own entire life.I have had to forgive you for so many things I don't think you realize, I still had to force myself to get up in the morning to take care of these kids and to lay your clothes out for you even when you had hurt me so badly. I still laid myself out for you, physically and mentally, even when you were hurting me, lying to me, and even cheating on me by lusting. I feel like I don't really know you and I never did. I don't want to leave you because I do still love you, but I know that the relationship will not work because I will not be able to trust you again and the thought of you touching me makes me cringe now because you have hurt me so badly and I just don't really have any respect for you anymore. your family has been so lenient on you and you have never really had any terrible consequences for your actions, and I think that's why you continue to repeat them. honestly you should lose custody of your son temporarily, lose your license, go to jail, or some kind of serious consequence so that you can have the possibility of actually learning from your mistakes. but I am not God and it is not my responsibility to decide what your punishment should be. I am your wife and I have the right to put my foot down when it's necessary. but I don't have the right to make choices that are going to permanently alter your life. what I can say is that it's not normal that you continue to lie even though you know it's wrong. I wish you would tell me why.but all you have seem to have for me in the past are excuses that are usually empty. if we are going to remain married I want our marriage to work as a partnership for the business so that it can still glorify god, and I would like to help you raise holden. but I need it to be very clear, it is still required for you to be faithful to me but I have no interest in being your wife any longer. I'm going to keep my commitment by staying married to you but that is it. just the fact that youkeep lying to me tells me that you really never were committed to me and you don't understand the concept of being one flesh. you are not capable of having a successful marriage so even if I leave you, you'll screw up your next marriage because you just can't stop lying. it's really sad because you have such potential to be such a beautiful and amazing person,but your inability to fight The temptations of your flesh and your lack of empathy when it comes to lying is your greatest downfall. I will continue to pray for you just as your family does, but I am going to do what your family does which is limit what I give you and refrain from even hugging you because I finally figured out why your mother doesn't want to hug you. it's not because you have herpes. it's because you have broke and shattered her heart so many times by lying to her that she doesn't want to hug you at all. because hugging you means she is letting you back in, but she knows you're just going to hurt her again. I don't want you to touch me again because I know that you're just going to hurt me again, and it feels like I am giving myself to you even when you don't deserve it if I would let you touch me. I don't want you to touch me again. I completely understand why your mother does not want to hug you. I feel the exact same way now. I can love you from a distance but that is it. the coronavirus has nothing to do with why she doesn't want to hug you, and I could see it in her eyes that she was hurting when I asked her why she doesn't hug you. she doesn't want to say it because it hurts her heart so badly, but she doesn't want to be completely close to you because she doesn't trust you and she knows you're going to hurt her. I feel her pain and now I finally understand your mother and have so much more respect for her.you tend to distance yourself from people and love them from a distance when they hurt you, it shows forgiveness on her part because she still is very persistent to have a relationship with you, and my heart hurts for your mother. I can only pray my children will never put me through what you have done to her. and I can only pray that if I do get a safe way out of this marriage that you will never hurt someone else because what you put your extra and what you have put me through are honestly just traumatizing and extremely hard to heal from, but I know the Lord has a plan for me and I am going to remain your wife, I'm going to pray that God will make a way for me so that I will be able to glorify him in a better way, but instead I'm constantly depressed because the person who is supposed to be my other half betrays me on a regular basis.it wasn't always like this. at one point I fully trusted you, I literally trusted you. before I ever went through your phone, I treated you like a king every single day and night, you told me I was the woman of your dreams and that you couldn't picture your life without me and that's why you asked me to marry you. I never would have said yes if I knew that you just would never stop lying to me.it is impossible to become one flesh when there are secrets in the marriage. you might feel that you have to walk on eggshells around me, and that's probably true because I have had to put a wall up and I have become extremely paranoid ever since the lies kept stacking up. the more you lie to me, the more my wall goes up in the more this whole house has so much tension. cause and effect is a very simple concept, I was good to you and you betrayed me time and time again, and honestly it really is affecting my mental health. before I was with you, I left my ex for much less than this. when I was alone, I was happy and dedicated to the Lord every single day, I don't remember the last time I was this depressed. you probably wouldn't understand if you are actually sociopathic, but it really hurts when you trust somebody and they just keep lying to you. especially because when we first started dating you told me that you would leave me if I ever lied to you, and I promised you I never would because I really did want a wholesome life with you.I have no other words, I have thought long and hard about what I wanted to say and I am not meaning to be hurtful, but everything makes so much sense now and I can finally put my emotions away and think logically because now that I'm not so obsessed and in love with you, I can see you for what you really are.","It seems pretty obvious that you know what you have to do and you are now processing it. 

Everybody will tell you that dishonestly kills a marriage.    

Of course, everybody slips on the truth -- and that can be forgiven -- but your husband is leagues beyond that.","That was long, but hear. Definitely end things and move on. You can find much better out there.",,,,,,

I'll cut to the chase... I'm having a lot of trouble finding a reason to wake up in the morning, and I'm finding it harder and harder to sleep at night.

I'm caught in a lot of nihilistic thoughts. I can't help but think how meaningless my life truly is... I wake up, work, read the bible if I can, and sleep. Why do I even bother? What's the point in all of this? I'm just here to suffer until the appointed day of my death, and pray to God I'm saved. 

I can't commit suicide, because it's against the rules... but I truly cannot wait until I'm dead. I had a dream a month ago that I had contracted a disease and would be dead in a year, and I remember being upset when I woke up because I realized that it was just a dream, and that I'll probably still be here in a year.

I'm so alone. I've always been this way. No one to truly call a friend, always just stuck in my own head. It's gotten so bad that I've become a maladaptive daydreamer. I've been essentially isolated to my own head for so long that I've built a detailed world just to escape the reality of my own life. It's to the point where I'm almost in pain. I can't stop catching myself drift off into that world, only to remember that none of it's real, and I'm stuck here, alone. It's become an even more painful reminder, and less of an escape.

All this of course leads to depression. I've been fighting depression ever since I was a teenager. Just the feeling of low self-worth, a bottomless pit of hopelessness. I can't seem to shake it.

Please pray for me. I can't continue on like this. I need relief. Just someone to call a friend. Just a thought that maybe life is worth living.

HOWEVER even if the “7 deadly sins” thing was real, if you come to god with true sincerity and remorse he will forgive you. i think the only thing God considers above all sin is blasphemy. that seems to be the one thing the bible really gets heavy on.

“ ""Therefore I say to you, any sin and blasphemy shall be forgiven men, but blasphemy against the Spirit shall not be forgiven.” (Matthew 12 [i think])

- “Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it shall be forgiven him; but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, either in this age or in the age to come” (Mathew ??, also 12 i think)

- “but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin” (Mark 4:29)

**there’s a bunch more scripture quotes mentioning blasphemy if you feel like going down the google rabbit hole.**

anyway, if it’s really bothering you that bad, if my knowledge is correct, when you are baptized (in good faith repentance , with no wickedness or altering motives) your sins will be washed away, i think going to a confessional does this as well. 




as long as what ever sin you committed you feel full remorse for and seek forgiveness  you’re going to be okay.","A deadly sin is not a particularly unforgivable sin. They are simply ones that, if nurtured, lead to other sins and so are best rooted out. It sounds like you rooted one out, so that's good.",God forgives all that are contrite in heart.,,,,,,
350,,Christianity,"Well I doubt I'm the only one who feels like this from time to time but I always ask God why he did or does certain things. Like he knows everything then why would he create the Devil knowing that he would lead to the demise of humans, or why even create humans knowing that they are going to sin or even though their existence would probably mean nothing to them since he has all he needs and doesn't need anything else. Why did he only speak to certain people and not everyone can hear him today or have a sure thought that this is not just me making a voice in my head to believe he's there? Or why does he let people suffer when he could just get to the armageddon already. Or why he's so cruel in the OT and in Revelation.

Sometimes I would wonder how our religion is different from others, because miracles may happen in other people's religions, and they have strong beliefs in their gods and they wouldn't be swayed easily, but some cases it was what they had been to brought to believe by their peers or family, would God judge them to go to hell due to idolatry? Or with people who had to do wrong due to the conditions they're in, like people who had to kill or steal to survive will he still say they deserve hell?

I know some people say you need faith or he doesn't give answers to these for a reason but this is very perplexing for some one who thinks too much. I don't think I'll ever get answers for some of these questions but honestly I hate feeling this way, it really hits me hard mentally.

I could just decide to ignore everything and become an atheist but that won't work because these questions will still haunt me, I mean I'm sure somewhere in the bible it says to teach your children how to be and it will stick  till the future. And I know this to be true because I can try to ignore christianity but it'll still stick and I'll feel bad when I sin or will ask if this is really right, and another blow to my mentality. 

Honestly it's really frustrating, I can't ask unless I go to heaven and ask God himself but there's no shortcut to that, and I can't die and hope to go to some place in the middle because there is no middle. I don't like this mental frustration, I don't like asking myself whether a God exists or not or why he does things the way he does.

Sometimes I figure out why he does something and it strengthens my faith and I'll be happy about it that I've gotten a stronger belief in God because of it, but then it always affects me mentally and I really hate that, I really just wish we could talk to him on earth and he could reply with his voice and explain at times, I really would love that.

I don't know I may be crazy, but honestly what am I supposed to do when these questions come up? I can't just run away from them because I'll still have to face them once again probably in a different way. I never hear christians ever talk about this subject but I personally believe it's something really crucial.

&gt; This is an automated message","Why.. well, how will you know if someone loves you without choice? We have the option to reject God, we aren’t robots. Free will is a beautiful thing. It helps us learn about ourselves and the hearts desire. I would say Earth is like a battleground, ground 0, and we learn here from our experience in life, and satan is a tempter, he creates illusions of love, friendship, power, etc, but it’s a fake false hope that will swallow up a lot of people. satan hates us because he lost, and God loves us. Now he wants to rob, kill, and destroy anything we have, and bring us down w him..

 but scripture tell us how to handle these experiences, even the painful ones, to help lead us to be healed and live a nice life. Trust Jesus, repent, walk in the good and righteous, and let God lead :)","A few books I would recommend to you, all written by atheists who converted to the faith, include:

Mere Christianity by CS Lewis - philosophical

Evidence that Demands a Verdict by Josh McDowell - historical

God's Crime Scene and Cold Case Christianity both by J. Warner Wallace - cosmological

353,,Christianity,"I had a grandmother who was in my opinion the representation of what a Christian should be. She was born in 1944 to a non-denominational Christian family in Newfoundland and Labrador, which became part of Canada when she was 5 years old. The only story I know of her childhood was that at one point her mother gifted her with a dress. Unfortunately she got the dress dirty and hid in the outhouse from her mother who would be angry. When she grew to be an adult, she believed that God had called her to witness to other people. And so she did.

She preached around the island of Newfoundland and wrote poems and songs in God's name. Many of these poems and songs still run today, but unfortunately I don't remember the name of any of them, as it's been a long time. She once told me of how in the 1970s she was preaching to a crowd on the right way to treat children. One woman who looked guilty got up and left. Then she met my grandfather, who had lost his faith after his family fled from Germany during World War II and had taken to smoking.

Together they had numerous children, including my father. My grandmother convinced my grandfather to start looking into the Christian religion again by 1986, but before he could he died from lung cancer. My grandmother had a mental breakdown and my father and uncle were put into the fostercare system, where they suffered through much abuse. My father came out with a motive to be successful, while my uncle became a financial leech who never had enough to get by. My father eventually got married to my mother and had me first and then my brother. My grandmother eventually recovered, and she told me of other things that happened to her, all of which I believe happened sometime in the 1990s.

She once told me that when she woke up one morning, and looked out her window. She said she saw the city of New Jerusalem and it stayed there the entire day. She also once said that God lifted her up towards heaven, but she was frightened so God put her down. She also recounted a story that at one point she encountered Satan in a Sobeys store disguised as a beautiful man. My grandmother was afraid, she said, but angels protected her so that Satan couldn't harm her. She moved to St. John's, Newfoundland and lived a quiet life with her friend, who would help her with things she needed.

By 2012 however she could no longer take care of herself, and she was submitted into a senior citizens home in the city. By this time my parents divorced and my mother had custody of my brother and I. We visited her whenever we could, and it was there she told me these stories. She always preferred the King James Version translation of the Bible, as do I. Her visits always made me feel closer to God, and She was a very kind soul, and it was unfortunate that by late 2018 her health began to decline. The last time I saw her, she said she had a vision that I would witness to other people as well, like she had done.

Unfortunately she and her old friend fell out, and in January 2019 she went into a coma, and died a week later.

I’m going into seminary after I graduate and want to spread the truth about Christianity as much as I can please feel free to DM me if you have any questions or want to know any more details about the experiences I’ve had. 

my brother drove back from college out of nowhere one day and he was acting like he was mentally ill- after a few weeks he was still not better and he wouldnt consent to get help from a mental place so we had to get him escorted by the police- in the cop car out of nowhere the cop started talking about christianity and st peter- my brother left something with the cop and my dad had the cops number and texted the cop the cop called back my dad and talked for a while about family unity and how important it is- my brother came back and was a little better but still fucked up and every single specialist he saw said that he was perfectly fine- he saw like 12 specialist- my mom contacted the church and they said he was probably possessed and they ordered us for 30 days to not watch tv or listen to music unless it was christian and also no social media- he was extremely angry for no reason- he threw up constantly after my mom put holy water in food- he got extremely mad when he heard I was writing sermons and pulled out his phone and pressed something thar cut off the wifi- he didnt eat right, didnt walk right, barely showered, room was a mess, I hard him groan and say no repeatedly at 2 am, ect- he was possessed- after about a few weeks nothing had changed and I started praying a lot and started asking god for visions or anything so I would know that my family was being helped- one night my family went to the beach and i was home by myself because i had to write a paper and after

 i finished(i could still do homework online despite the 30 day thing) I started watching an online sermon and at the end the preacher said repeat after me and it was a prayer about being born again- i repeated the prayer and felt something come over me and out of nowhere i started crying- after a couple minutes i went to the bathroom and saw a white orb on the ground and knew it was an angel- i looked at it from different angles and it was still there

I tried to reason through it and thought my eyes or my mind were playing a trick and about a week or 2 later I prayed for an undeniable vision that could not be explained in any way and that night after i prayed I woke up at like 4:30 am and prayed again for my brother and no more than 30 seconds later I saw a quick flash of light on my ceiling that was not from outside or anything it was a small quick flash- i still tried to reason through it and I watched another online sermon and read the bible until around 6:30-6:45 and I fell asleep again

(i was sober when this happened btw)
Right when i fell asleep I went into a vision- I felt gusts of wind that was like a storm on the beach and I could feel it and hear it and then i couldnt see anything and went blind and i felt my dad get on top of me and i felt anger and i was getting slapped repeatedly- i didnt feel pain but i knew i was being slapped- i couldnt move at all but after a few seconds he went away and i couldnt move but eventually i could move my feet then the rest of my body and i immediately knew it was god- i sat on the side of my bed then i woke up out of the vision and i was still laying in bed- it was exactly 7:00- 7 is God’s number of perfection- what i got from the vision was that god wanted me to wake up and not doubt and get my shit together

that happened at the end of november and I stopped smoking as much but still did and didn’t fully give myself to god until a few days ago- I wanted to have a spiritual experience so I decided to trip and  when I tripped I felt this evil presence come over me 
about an hour after I tripped I felt this ringing in my ears and I started feeling this evil presence almost like my body was being taken over and I felt like I was dying it wouldn’t go away and I layed on my bed and I wasn’t even controlling my body. I closed my eyes and felt like I was being brought to hell and God showed me that I was dirty and how sin destroys a person. He showed me that I had a decision to make and I was shown how terrible hell was and the suffering that happens and my body was taken over and I repeatedly said “God help me” but it wasn’t even me saying it- it came out automatically . I sat up- i still wasn’t in control- and I saw the bag of weed that I just bought the day before- I had to give myself fully to god or die and go to hell- he showed me my future if i didnt change and he showed me my body being found- i waited for the feeling to go away but it wouldn’t and I felt like god was leaving me and then i came to my senses and was thinking what the fuck am i doing- i got up and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror and saw that it was as if i was slowly being possessed by a demon- i got my weed and shrooms and flushed it down the toilet and immediately felt the presence of god come over me and was at peace

also a few weeks ago i heard my dad trying to wake me up from outside my room and was yelling and i yelled back that i was awake but i checked my phone and it was 4:20 and my dad wasnt outside- it was god trying to tell me again to get my shit together and stop smoking

and when i was shown Hell i was shown a man burning with fire all around and trying to get out of Hell but he couldn’t and immediately after I saw this something took control of my body and i grabbed my phone and my eyes were almost completely closed but I somehow typed a perfect text without errors to my brother and said that I knew we had a bad relationship the past few years but i wanted to put that to an end

also a part i left out was that i told God that id give the rest of my life to him if he proved to me that he was real and then i had the experience where i was slapped and i still didnt really fully give myself- and also before i tripped i had a lot of questions mainly about how the universe was formed because that kinda was affecting my faith- right after i was at peace when i flushed everything down the toilet I could hear the holy spirit and my questions were answered- i closed my eyes and saw complete whiteness all around me like a blank canvas and I had infinite knowledge almost like the knowledge of God when I went into this vision. Everything was perfection and I saw a red letter “C” that was perfectly drawn then I saw the letter become imperfect and crooked and messed up and there were several white figure that looked like an angel and one strayed from God- it was the fall of lucifer- and it was the beginning of imperfection- i think this was telling me how the world became imperfect and how corruption came to Earth. When I was seeing all of this happen by brain was flooded with so much knowledge as if I knew everything and this happened at no other part during the trip or at any other moment during my life. I understood the creation of the universe and that God could speak thing into existence and that the world was basically one massive story- after a while and after I came out of this vision I lost all of the knowledge I had- i assume that God did not allow me to keep it possibly because it was the knowledge of God and that he just wanted to answer the questions I had

two days ago i was in my bathroom and i was looking at a mirror and i thought i saw a white thing streak across in the reflection and i was thinking it was a spirit but i wasnt sure if it was good or evil but i felt no fear and i said “if you are good i welcome you, but if you are not then i don’t and i am a child of God and there is nothing you can do” a few seconds later i looked in the mirror again and i saw an apparition float from left to right in the mirror then it was out of sight and it was darkish and i couldnt see it perfectly because it was quick but i remember it looking similar to like a dementor from harry potter

Recently I had a dream where  i was in some part of Hell with a bunch of other people and I was warned how sin corrupts each part of the soul and I was shown lust as green slime coming out of part of a soul and i learned how terrified demons were of angels because they were so much more powerful. I was given “matthew 2:12” near the end of the dream and I did not know where it came from (looking back now it was from God) and I did not know the verse. I woke up and looked it up and it was “And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.” God spoke to me and warned me through this dream.

&lt;p&gt;I tried to reason through it and thought my eyes or my mind were playing a trick and about a week or 2 later I prayed for an undeniable vision that could not be explained in any way and that night after i prayed I woke up at like 4:30 am and prayed again for my brother and no more than 30 seconds later I saw a quick flash of light on my ceiling that was not from outside or anything it was a small quick flash- i still tried to reason through it and I watched another online sermon and read the bible until around 6:30-6:45 and I fell asleep again&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(i was sober when this happened btw)
Right when i fell asleep I went into a vision- I felt gusts of wind that was like a storm on the beach and I could feel it and hear it and then i couldnt see anything and went blind and i felt my dad get on top of me and i felt anger and i was getting slapped repeatedly- i didnt feel pain but i knew i was being slapped- i couldnt move at all but after a few seconds he went away and i couldnt move but eventually i could move my feet then the rest of my body and i immediately knew it was god- i sat on the side of my bed then i woke up out of the vision and i was still laying in bed- it was exactly 7:00- 7 is God’s number of perfection- what i got from the vision was that god wanted me to wake up and not doubt and get my shit together&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;that happened at the end of november and I stopped smoking as much but still did and didn’t fully give myself to god until a few days ago- I wanted to have a spiritual experience so I decided to trip and  when I tripped I felt this evil presence come over me 
about an hour after I tripped I felt this ringing in my ears and I started feeling this evil presence almost like my body was being taken over and I felt like I was dying it wouldn’t go away and I layed on my bed and I wasn’t even controlling my body. I closed my eyes and felt like I was being brought to hell and God showed me that I was dirty and how sin destroys a person. He showed me that I had a decision to make and I was shown how terrible hell was and the suffering that happens and my body was taken over and I repeatedly said “God help me” but it wasn’t even me saying it- it came out automatically . I sat up- i still wasn’t in control- and I saw the bag of weed that I just bought the day before- I had to give myself fully to god or die and go to hell- he showed me my future if i didnt change and he showed me my body being found- i waited for the feeling to go away but it wouldn’t and I felt like god was leaving me and then i came to my senses and was thinking what the fuck am i doing- i got up and went to the bathroom and looked in the mirror and saw that it was as if i was slowly being possessed by a demon- i got my weed and shrooms and flushed it down the toilet and immediately felt the presence of god come over me and was at peace&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also a few weeks ago i heard my dad trying to wake me up from outside my room and was yelling and i yelled back that i was awake but i checked my phone and it was 4:20 and my dad wasnt outside- it was god trying to tell me again to get my shit together and stop smoking&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;and when i was shown Hell i was shown a man burning with fire all around and trying to get out of Hell but he couldn’t and immediately after I saw this something took control of my body and i grabbed my phone and my eyes were almost completely closed but I somehow typed a perfect text without errors to my brother and said that I knew we had a bad relationship the past few years but i wanted to put that to an end&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;also a part i left out was that i told God that id give the rest of my life to him if he proved to me that he was real and then i had the experience where i was slapped and i still didnt really fully give myself- and also before i tripped i had a lot of questions mainly about how the universe was formed because that kinda was affecting my faith- right after i was at peace when i flushed everything down the toilet I could hear the holy spirit and my questions were answered- i closed my eyes and saw complete whiteness all around me like a blank canvas and I had infinite knowledge almost like the knowledge of God when I went into this vision. Everything was perfection and I saw a red letter “C” that was perfectly drawn then I saw the letter become imperfect and crooked and messed up and there were several white figure that looked like an angel and one strayed from God- it was the fall of lucifer- and it was the beginning of imperfection- i think this was telling me how the world became imperfect and how corruption came to Earth. When I was seeing all of this happen by brain was flooded with so much knowledge as if I knew everything and this happened at no other part during the trip or at any other moment during my life. I understood the creation of the universe and that God could speak thing into existence and that the world was basically one massive story- after a while and after I came out of this vision I lost all of the knowledge I had- i assume that God did not allow me to keep it possibly because it was the knowledge of God and that he just wanted to answer the questions I had&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;two days ago i was in my bathroom and i was looking at a mirror and i thought i saw a white thing streak across in the reflection and i was thinking it was a spirit but i wasnt sure if it was good or evil but i felt no fear and i said “if you are good i welcome you, but if you are not then i don’t and i am a child of God and there is nothing you can do” a few seconds later i looked in the mirror again and i saw an apparition float from left to right in the mirror then it was out of sight and it was darkish and i couldnt see it perfectly because it was quick but i remember it looking similar to like a dementor from harry potter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I had a dream where  i was in some part of Hell with a bunch of other people and I was warned how sin corrupts each part of the soul and I was shown lust as green slime coming out of part of a soul and i learned how terrified demons were of angels because they were so much more powerful. I was given “matthew 2:12” near the end of the dream and I did not know where it came from (looking back now it was from God) and I did not know the verse. I woke up and looked it up and it was “And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they returned to their country by another route.” God spoke to me and warned me through this dream. I’ve also had other nightmares recently where I called unto the Lord and woke up immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

Beelzebub, for example, is a reference to 2 Kings 1. After King Ahab rejected God's covenant with Israel by sacrificing his own sons, his predecessor Ahaziah fell and was injured and sought the advice of Beelzebub, the God of Ekron;

""So he sent messengers, saying to them, “Go and consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron, to see if I will recover from this injury.”

But the angel of the Lord said to Elijah the Tishbite, “Go up and meet the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, ‘Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going off to consult Baal-Zebub, the god of Ekron?’""

This is the only place in the Hebrew Scriptures where Beelzebub is mentioned, and it leads to the events in 2 Kings 2, where God is glorified through Elijah, and sends his spirit to Elisha (a very significant point in the covenant Jesus fulfills).

Additionally, the reference to Satan standing against Satan is a reference to Numbers 22:22 where the first use of the word for ""satan"" is found. In this portion, we see that an angel of the Lord is standing as ""a satan"" or ""an opposer/adversary"" against Balaam who is going to Balak (who wants him to curse Israel). So in this instance we have an Angel of the Lord standing as an adversary against Balaam who was doing something adversarial to God's will. In other words, this is another instance where ""satan"" stands against ""satan"" and a kingdom comes to an end (in this case it was the end of Balak/Balaam/Peor and the beginning of Israel as God's distinguished nation).

I also enjoy the ""if it is by the finger of God that I cast out demons"" because it is reference to Jesus representing the importance of the ten commandments which were written by the finger of God on stone tablets, and the power that living according to these commandments has over evil influences.",,,,,,

This occurred after Jesus died for 3 days and went to Abraham’s bosom for OT saints.  When you die now, you go to heaven.  Paul shows us this by saying “to be absent from the body is to be in the presence of Christ”.  He said this while contemplating death.  

Hell is not open for business yet.  Unbelievers are in “Sheol”, a sort of unpleasant waiting place.  Reading in Revelation, you will see that Hell will be opened up during the end time events.  At that point, unbelievers will be resurrected and go before the throne judgement.  Then they, all demons, the antichrist, false witness, and Satan will be cast into Hell for all of eternity.","Only a few people are in heaven now. Moses, Elijah, Enoch and a few other saints that were raised when Jesus died.

Nobody is burning yet (and nobody will burn forever). Most people are just dead. And the dead know nothing and have no feelings. They're unconscious like when you sleep:

&gt;For the living know that they will die; But the dead know nothing, And they have no more reward, For the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, their hatred, and their envy have now perished; Nevermore will they have a share In anything done under the sun. [...] Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there  is no work or device or knowledge or wisdom in the grave where you are going.
Ecclesiastes 9:5‭-‬6‭, ‬10 NKJV

&gt;These things He said, and after that He said to them, “Our friend Lazarus sleeps, but I go that I may wake him up.” Then His disciples said, “Lord, if he sleeps he will get well.” However, Jesus spoke of his death, but they thought that He was speaking about taking rest in sleep.

All shooting and violence stops.  But then, so does every harsh word, impure thought, and lie.  Sleeping in too much (sloth), being overly concerned with your appearance, gossiping - every time you or anyone else makes a moral error, your mind and will are overridden and you are forced to make a better choice.

I suspect that if we lived in such a world, we would be complaining about the problem of goodness, not the problem of evil.

Free will is the fundamental building block of our personality and humanity.  Without it, we are mere automatons with no moral worth.  To rip it away from someone is a violation of the worst kind.  Could God do it?  Sure.  But He is wise enough to realize that the harms outweigh the benefits.","When Peter asked Jesus about John’s life, Jesus replied, ‘If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? You must follow me."" (John 21:22) You’re questioning your faith because of what happens to others, which the Bible gives us an example of what not to do. 

Free will is a gift from God. Some people exercise it by following Christ, and others, by following evil influence/temptation. That is not God’s doing, but He is aware that it is going to happen. Suffering is apart of human life. Persecution always has, is and will happen.

The wages of sin is death. We are all going to die. We are all sinful. But whether you have eternal life, that is what is important about our current lives here. Have you accepted Christ as your saviour? Do you believe He died on the cross for your sins? Have you committed your life to Him?

Yes, salvation is a whole lot easier than people make it out to be. But your belief in God is more than looking for an easy way in. 

And as far as fairness, In many people’s minds, fairness is everyone receiving exactly what he or she deserves. If God were completely “fair,” by this definition, we would all spend eternity in hell paying for our sin, which is exactly what we deserve. We have all sinned against God (Romans 3:23) and are therefore worthy of eternal death (Romans 6:23). If we “fairly” received what we deserve, we would end up in the lake of fire (Revelation 20:14–15). But God is merciful and good, so He sent Jesus Christ to die on the cross in our place, taking the punishment that we deserve (2 Corinthians 5:21). All we have to do is believe in Christ and we will be saved, and we will receive an eternal home in heaven (John 3:16). With the sacrifice of Christ, God maintains His “fairness” in that sin is adequately punished.

The murderer that you reference will only get into heaven with a true relationship with God. Not just by saying “the sinner’s prayer”.","""tell me how is it fair that a repentant murderer can go to heaven but someone who led a good life and helped others and was kind to others has to go to hell simply for not believing in the right thing""

and I think hell is more compacted them we traditionally think 

(""There will be weeping there, and **gnashing of teeth**, when you see Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves thrown out.) - Luke 13:28

(God assails me and tears me in his anger and **gnashes his teeth at me**; my opponent fastens on me his piercing eyes.) - Job 16:9

perhaps you are the cause of your suffering

the fire of hell could be metaphorical

(For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but sent them to hell, putting them in **chains of darkness** to be held for judgment;) - 2 Peter 2:4

or even in the tribulation when God's wrath is being poured out into the world the people aren't sorry or begging for forgiveness

(They were seared by the intense heat and **they cursed the name of God**, who had control over these plagues, but **they refused to repent and glorify him**.) - Revelation 16:9

(and **cursed the God of heaven** because of their pains and their sores, but **they refused to repent of what they had done**.) - Revelation 16:11

so even tho they hate their current situation they hate God enough to prefer the ""intense heat"" than to repent and glorify him","Getting into Heaven isn't easy. It's simple - but not easy. 

In fact, a certain *Someone* had to be crucified for anyone to be able to make it, a certain *Someone* had to be crushed under the Wrath of God, and a certain *Someone* had to live a completely sinless life. 

&gt;at least for deep rational thinkers its not a choice.

Any sort of thought whatsoever about primal origin will lead you directly to God, or an avoidance of the question. Those are the only two options you have. 

&gt;now tell me how is it fair that a repentant murderer can go to heaven but someone who led a good life and helped others and was kind to others has to go to hell simply for not believing in the right thing

End of comment. 

(Spelling mistakes were theirs, not mine)



My original Comment (scroll for shortened version):

Yes, we do know that in fact, Jesus Christ, a man born of African descent was not a white man. (As most people are able to make that connection).

And yes, in fact, Jesus wasn't just friends with people who followed God. As stated in luke 5:32

 ""I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.""

So fun fact: Most people know that Jesus was not a white man (And do not care about his color). And Jesus did make friends with prostitutes, murderers, and ate with sinners, yet he did not sin even once. He didn't have sex with any women, He stole not once, he was never immoral in anything. And when you say temper tantrum, do you mean when he flipped the tables in a place of worship in luke 19:35-36. 

""And he went into the temple, and began to cast out them that sold therein, and them that bought;  Saying unto them, It is written, My house is the house of prayer: but ye have made it a den of thieves.""

After he was justifiably angry because a place of worship, was turned into a place of thieves and robbers?

What a shocker! Jesus got mad?!?! What? A human person had emotions!?! Impossible. Ik its crazy. Jesus was a human like the rest of us.

But did he kill anyone in his anger? Did he curse at anyone? Did he become filled with hate? No, he simply made them leave the temple. To be honestb I don't think anyone cares what color Jesus was.

And yes he did change the lives of prostitutes, murderers, and sinners.

And yes. He did have a human emotions called ""anger"" after something happened that was understandable to get angry about. 

So yes, in fact Jesus was human




(shortened):

Yes, most people know Jesus was not white.

Yes, Jesus made friends and changed the lives of prostitutes, murderers, and sinners, as says in luke 5:32 

""I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.""

And yes, Jesus got angry when he found out people had made his temple, into a market, or ""den of thieves""

Lule 19:35-36

So yes, Jesus was not white,

he changed the lives of sinners,

and he was justifiably angry because he had a right to be, and hes a human with human emotions.

&amp;quot;Also Fun Fact: the reason Jesus looks white with long hair and not like how a normal person from that area would look is because that spesific version was (and im not kidding-) Leonardo Da Vinci&amp;#39;s male lover painted as Jesus. I&amp;#39;m not kidding! Thats the only reason why he was drawn as a white man from that point on. Thats a fun one to scream out at parties. So the Jesus &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; know may also be flawed. My favorite time was when he threw a temper tantrum. Or when he made friends with prostitutes!

Thats ok, considering the whole thing could work to your advantage.  Here is what I mean.  You did something that will cause pain for all parties.  Sounds like you accept this and that is really good to hear.  As you are convicted over the wrong committed, you counter that, with running to the Lord.  This means forget the girl, and focus on the King.  Even though the road might get wicked for a minute, the sooner you seek forgiveness (with her, no matter who she is), and repent of that, you will be in a good place.

Might not feel like that for a while, because you kinda created a storm for yourself.  I have been here more times than I care for, but I can say that the taste of that life is disgusting, and unprofitable.  One thing that stuck with me over the years, is I was responsible for causing others to have a terrible view of my God.  I was hindering others from possibly finding this truth, because I was lukewarm.

You’re gonna have to take the road ahead on the chin, but it will make you a better soldier later, able to help others in that scenario.

Praying for you to stay the course and do the things you don’t want to (spiritual), for the flesh is strong if we feed it more.  Starve your flesh with soaking yourself in the Word, and be ready for the next battle..",,,,,,,,

And that’s not to get into the tension between a dynamic vs formal equivalence methodology (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_and_formal_equivalence#Approaches_to_translation).

The good news is that if we look at major versions side-by-side for any particular passage you’ll see that there’s no real danger of “mistranslation” as on a large scale level we can see that the translators and editors  got the job done. We can go straight to the original Greek and read an interlinear version and see that the general meaning is being conveyed.

So the forest is fine, it’s some particular trees that there’s legitimate debate about and that gets into what is the theological bias of any translation and how much did that bias affect the translation.

A great example of this is how Phoebe is treated by Saint Paul’s letter to the Romans. In the letter, St Paul refers to her as “diakonos” the word from which we get the ordained position of “deacon.” 

In the new revised standard version, which is more ecumenical and willing to follow the biblical scholarship wherever it goes, St Paul calls her a “deacon” in the main text and a footnote gives the alternative of “minister.”

In the more theologically conservative ESV, which  is intended to be a readable word for word translation, St Paul calls her a “servant” with a footnote allowing the alternative of “deaconess.”

The above may sound like it’s down in the weeds but it’s important with regard to the controversy over ordination of women. You can’t have biblical support for the ordination of women if you take out/whitewash the biblical support for the ordination of women.

Theological conservatives will say, “but diakonos just means  servant and ordained Deacons came later.” Theological liberals would say, “a deacon is literally what she was and this is just patriarchal whitewashing.”

The irony is that ordained deacons do not administer the sacraments however the ESV translation committee didn’t want to get into the nuances of priests versus deacons and deacons versus deaconesses and instead they were happy to deviate from their own stated methodology of literal translation in order to render a translation that supported their theological biases.

So on the one hand, yes that is problematic, on the other hand, the ESV is still a superb translation, although I do take issue with similar episodes such as their shameful handling of slavery where they are to apt to use soft euphemistic language such as “bond servants.”

And to get to your point about LGBT, one of the issues roiling the faith is that the Greek St Paul used lands neither side a knockout blow.

It is clear that St Paul condemns certain homosexual acts, however the word he mostly used, arsenokoitai, is a word that he essentially coined and that is not  used in other contemporaneous texts so gauging the exact meaning is difficult. This is important as the context and sub text allows the interpretation that St  Paul is not condemning LGBT relationships as we understand them today (loving, equal, consensual) as the cultural and social context of St Paul’s era meant that certain homosexual acts were viewed as degrading/humiliating/emasculating  to the receiving party. We know this because when Roman politicians insulted each other they would not say “Octavius is gay” they would say “Octavius  is a bottom [and thus a woman].” For the most part we’ve lost the connection to how shameful calling into question a man’s masculinity was back then with being called a “sissy” a remnant of how provocative an assault it was (same way how today’s custom of the  bride’s family being  expected to pay for the wedding is a leftover of the ancient dowry system). 

Furthermore, we know that that word St Paul coined is problematic as different major historical translations translated that word completely differently.  For example the Latin Vulgate translated that word as “pimping out men,” Luther’s translation translated it as “pederasty” and the king James translated it as yet a third that I do not recall offhand. 

Everyone can agree that each of those is a different word, yet when the RSV committee translated that word they decided that that word meant “homosexual,” thus kicking off the present debate.

It is precisely because scripture is so important that translation is important and while we can disagree and debate the exact meanings of certain words from 2000 years ago that still doesn’t change the fact that these are issues on the margin and the vast majority of the text is not in dispute.

God bless

Edited for typos and clarity 

Sidenote on arsenokoitai: if you Google it the first several pages will be surface level theologically conservative defenses over how the word applies to homosexuality. You have to dig deeper to find  the boring scholarship that contests that. That  reflects good marketing as if you can capture the market on search engine results  your perspective may become the dominant one. I bring this up to draw the parallel to the major apologetics websites that have authoritative URLs such as “Gospel coalition” etc. yet are simply presenting one particular perspective to the exclusion of others (And the majority of the apologetics sites not only exclude other voices but actively denigrate other atonement theories or a Catholic or Orthodox view of the sacraments).

Finally, the above is not to deny that there are some translations that are problematic such as the Jehovah’s Witness translation or translations that are effectively paraphrase.","I've watched pastors give hour-and-a-half long sermons over the meaning of the word ""Agape"" (Ah-gah-pay, not uh-gape), with the connotations of the original Greek being fairly far removed from our loose English equivalent of ""love"".

So really, I don't have any problem believing there are minor mistranslations. The broad strokes, on the other hand, aren't so easily dismissed. I'd look elsewhere for reconciliation there. (Personally, I find myself deferring to the Greatest Commandment; it's hard to go wrong with that.)","&gt;	I keep hearing people say that the Bible is mistranslated

Which Bible? There are hundreds of English translations of Scripture, and thousands more in other languages. There’s no such thing as a perfect translation, but some are better than others, so it’s good to compare multiple versions of the Bible when you’re studying, as well as looking to the Hebrew and Greek yourself if you’re able to.",dc32774e-27d6-11e5-b6e8-0e5e20c89e15,,,,,

Psalm 91:1

&amp;#x200B;

There is a lot of fearmongering everywhere you turn today—on the news, in the papers, via social media, and unfortunately, on Christian media as well. However, it is vital that we do not let fear take over our hearts.

As believers, we have no business feeding on fear. If your mind is entangled with knots of anxiety, perhaps it’s time for you to examine your mental diet.

What have you, consciously or unconsciously, been meditating on? Are you ingesting and believing everything you see in the news reports, or are you living by what the Lord Jesus has purchased for you at Calvary?

To help you understand God’s heart for you regarding fear and your walking in His protection, I want to share with you a powerful key from today’s verse, the very first verse of Psalm 91, the prayer of protection. The Hebrew word for “dwell” is yashab, which means “to sit down, to remain, or to settle.”

Notice that the very first thing that God wants you to do to enjoy His protection is to rest. His protection, peace, love, and other blessings flow in your life when you are in a place of rest.

Let’s camp on the word dwell just a little more. Let’s meditate on what it means to rest or “sit down.” The Bible says that we are seated with Christ at God’s right hand (Eph. 2:6, Heb. 1:3). The word “seated” is beautiful—it means that you are no longer standing and working.

Under the old covenant, the priest had to offer the morning sacrifice at 9 a.m., and then remain standing for six hours until after the evening sacrifice at 3 p.m. Our Lord Jesus was crucified at 9 a.m. and He hung on the cross for six hours until He died at 3 p.m., thus fulfilling the type of both the morning and evening sacrifices (Heb. 10:11–12).

Because Jesus became the final sacrifice, the work of the priest is done and he no longer has to stand. Because our Lord cried, “It is finished!” at Calvary (John 19:30), we are today seated in Christ. We can dwell in the secret place of the Most High—a place of peace, safety, and security—and we can live fear-free because the blood of our Lord Jesus has paid for every blessing of protection in Psalm 91!

Today, whether you are dealing with a difficult financial situation, a sleep disorder, or plagued by depressive or even suicidal thoughts, my desire is for you to discover a God who loves you, and whose strong hands of protection are over your entire life and over every area that concerns you.",t2_1rohrcre,False,,0,False,Seated With Christ,"[{'e': 'text', 't': 'Blog'}]",r/Christianity,False,7,blog,0,,False,t3_m2m8iw,False,dark,0.87,,public,6,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},Blog,False,6,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615483022.0,richtext,7,,,text,self.Christianity,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.&lt;/p&gt;

And know which vocation is really for you. While we all have to evangelize, not everyone job is to plant the seed. Others is to make it groe, and others is to harvest it or be a sun.","Not saying that you'll automatically have this problem, but there's this thing called the ""cage stage"" (and not just in Calvinist circles) that's a real and common problem - and often does far more harm than good. In my experience, overzealous ""newbies"" heading straight out the gate to evangelise tend to push away far more people than they're likely to attract. So there's a pretty good reason that denominations (or at least the more established ones) tend to require their preachers to have a fair amount of training before heading out into the world.  

But if you're so on fire that you can't help but to get out there straight away and spread the word, then at least try to link up with someone who's been at that sort of thing for a while. Even Paul linked up with Barnabas for a while when he first started out.

As other people have said, not everyone is called to be a preacher/teacher/evangelist/etc. Plenty of work can be done just by living your faith around the people you already know. Personally I've found that even just by doing that, people tend to get curious and start asking questions. If you want to do more, there's always plenty of Christian orgs that need help/support that you could get involved with (soup kitchens etc). Or to put it in biblical terms, ""*Religion that is pure and undefiled before God the Father is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep one-self unstained from the world.*"" (Jas 1:27)","I think the best evangelism, especially foe someone who isn't knowledgeable and practiced answering questions, is to just be Christian. That is, just be humble, loving, hardworking. When people see this and learn you are a Christian, then their opinion of Christianity is elevated.

&gt;In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.",,,,,,
394,,Christianity,"Today (in 1812)  a fire broke out in missionary William Carey's print shop in Serampore, India, causing an estimated £10,000 in damages and destroying other priceless work. Among the losses were many translations of Sanskrit literature and a polyglot dictionary of Sanskrit and related languages, and two grammar books.  The press itself and the punches were saved, and it took six months for it be working at full capacity again. Carey produced translations of the Bible in Bengali, Sanskrit, and other major languages and dialects. As news of the fire spread, it brought Careys work to wider attention and made him famous, bringing in funds and attracting volunteers. In Carey's lifetime, the mission printed and distributed the Bible in whole or part in 44 languages. 

India is an ancient melting pot for language formation and culture. A recent census indicated 19,500 languages or dialects are spoken in India as what are designated as ‘mother tongues’. Just the sheer scale of this can be quite confusing, but many of the languages overlap and have similar scripts. There are 121 languages which are spoken by 10,000 or more people in India. The Indian Constitution lists 22 languages, which have been referred to as scheduled languages and given recognition, status and official encouragement.  Sanskrit is the sacred language of Hinduism, the language of classical Hindu philosophy, and of historical texts of Buddhism and Jainism.  In the early medieval era Sanskrit became a language of religion and high culture, and of the political elites 

Careys work was two-way, as well as translating the Bible into Sanskrit he was able to translate some of the ancient Sanskrit texts into English and this was acknowledged by The Asiatic Society who commended Carey for “*his eminent services in opening the stores of Indian literature to the knowledge of Europe and for his extensive acquaintance with the science, the natural history and botany of this country and his useful contributions, in every branch.”*  Sanskrit can be dated back to the Indus Valley Civilisation, an early  Bronze Age civilisation in South Asia, together with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, and of the three, the most widespread. The oldest written language is Sumerian but there have been variations of Sanskrit earliest possible dates from 2000 B but they remain undeciphered.

William Carey didn’t start life as a linguist, when he was 14, his father apprenticed him to a cordwainer in Northamptonshire in central England. A cordwainer is a shoemaker who makes new shoes from new leather unlike a cobbler who, then at least, just repaired shoes. His master was an Anglican churchgoer like himself, but another apprentice was a Dissenter. Through his influence Carey would leave the Church of England and join with other Dissenters to form a small Congregational Church.  Later, he became acquainted with John Ryland and at the age of 22 was baptised by him and committed himself as a Baptist. Six years later he became the pastor of Harvey Lane Baptist Church in Leicester where he published his ground-breaking missionary manifesto, *An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens*. This lead to the founding of the Baptist Missionary Society, now known as the BMS World Mission.  They agreed to support the medical missionary, Dr John Thomas and Carey would accompany him to India.

Sailing with his family to India as a missionary, because the East India Company was hostile to missionaries, they settled in the Danish colony in Serampore where Carey started a school for impoverished children. They were taught reading, writing, accounting and Christianity.

Among the losses were many translations of Sanskrit literature and a polyglot dictionary of Sanskrit and related languages, and two grammar books.  The press itself and the punches were saved, and it took six months for it be working at full capacity again. Carey produced translations of the Bible in Bengali, Sanskrit, and other major languages and dialects. As news of the fire spread, it brought Careys work to wider attention and made him famous, bringing in funds and attracting volunteers. In Carey&amp;#39;s lifetime, the mission printed and distributed the Bible in whole or part in 44 languages. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;India is an ancient melting pot for language formation and culture. A recent census indicated 19,500 languages or dialects are spoken in India as what are designated as ‘mother tongues’. Just the sheer scale of this can be quite confusing, but many of the languages overlap and have similar scripts. There are 121 languages which are spoken by 10,000 or more people in India. The Indian Constitution lists 22 languages, which have been referred to as scheduled languages and given recognition, status and official encouragement.  Sanskrit is the sacred language of Hinduism, the language of classical Hindu philosophy, and of historical texts of Buddhism and Jainism.  In the early medieval era Sanskrit became a language of religion and high culture, and of the political elites &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Careys work was two-way, as well as translating the Bible into Sanskrit he was able to translate some of the ancient Sanskrit texts into English and this was acknowledged by The Asiatic Society who commended Carey for “&lt;em&gt;his eminent services in opening the stores of Indian literature to the knowledge of Europe and for his extensive acquaintance with the science, the natural history and botany of this country and his useful contributions, in every branch.”&lt;/em&gt;  Sanskrit can be dated back to the Indus Valley Civilisation, an early  Bronze Age civilisation in South Asia, together with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, and of the three, the most widespread. The oldest written language is Sumerian but there have been variations of Sanskrit earliest possible dates from 2000 B but they remain undeciphered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William Carey didn’t start life as a linguist, when he was 14, his father apprenticed him to a cordwainer in Northamptonshire in central England. A cordwainer is a shoemaker who makes new shoes from new leather unlike a cobbler who, then at least, just repaired shoes. His master was an Anglican churchgoer like himself, but another apprentice was a Dissenter. Through his influence Carey would leave the Church of England and join with other Dissenters to form a small Congregational Church.  Later, he became acquainted with John Ryland and at the age of 22 was baptised by him and committed himself as a Baptist. Six years later he became the pastor of Harvey Lane Baptist Church in Leicester where he published his ground-breaking missionary manifesto, &lt;em&gt;An Enquiry into the Obligations of Christians to use Means for the Conversion of the Heathens&lt;/em&gt;. This lead to the founding of the Baptist Missionary Society, now known as the BMS World Mission.  They agreed to support the medical missionary, Dr John Thomas and Carey would accompany him to India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sailing with his family to India as a missionary, because the East India Company was hostile to missionaries, they settled in the Danish colony in Serampore where Carey started a school for impoverished children. They were taught reading, writing, accounting and Christianity. He would also go on to found the Serampore College and the Serampore University, which claims to be the first degree-awarding university in India.&lt;/p&gt;

Churches as institution aren't super trustworthy in that regards - you're right. But the church the bible talks about it not necesserly a institution but just your people you gather with. 

You musnt allways be 100% on line with your local church as well. Look for a church where you feel the general climate of democratic discussion is good and where you feel that self-thinking in encouraged. Then you can walk up to the priest sometimes and realy engage with him and talk about his ideas and yours. Maybe he and you both learn something. 

The catholic church is.... good adjusted? Good organized? I dunno what to say honestly. I am Lutheran and I wouldnt ever think of joining the roman catholic church... But it's not like they are accross the board wrong or bad influence. If its the best organized church in your area, check it out and see if it works for you.","So I have only recently begun to return to the faith myself; after some challenging life events, and extremely conflicting, confusing attitudes within the church, I stopped trying. 

I never lost my faith, but I couldn't figure out what was wrong, and couldn't find anyone to help.

I looked to the story of Samuel in the Old Testament- ""speak Lord, thy servant hears you..."" And so I said ""if You speak, I'll listen,"" but stopped trying to actively practice the faith.

Not too long ago, it happened, in a way. I awoke in the middle of the night and felt something different... I felt drawn to go and listen to some Keith Green (which I highly recommend), and just started to tear up.

I started listening to the Bible in audio, and it started to come alive for me in a way it hadn't before. It became clear to me that the key thing is the *relationship,* and that *through* developing the relationship, He makes us into what we're meant to be.

I mean there's a lot more, but that's where I started. Every morning when I woke up I'd be like ""Hey, I'm here,"" and try to continuously invite Jesus to be in my life- at work, at home, etc. 

I don't know if any of this helps; I'm still figuring it out, and I'm definitely not the picture of righteousness. But I hope it at least gives you some new clue, some rock to look under, or something...

&amp;#x200B;

* Some genes seem to have changed at faster rates down the tree, some slower. Now the funny thing here, is that a lot of these numbers he like to say is arbitrary in their use? As fixed data points sure, but when you compare it against other data points. So we are closer to say, bonobos than lemurs, closer to mice than sharks. And so forth. We can build up trees based on these relative differences. Seriously, go play around with BLAST on common genes. Compare what you see to animal lineage models. If you are particular ambitious go use sequence data and tree building software. There are many wonderful sites that will let you download the tools yourself or upload your own FASTAs to build out comparison trees

&amp;#x200B;

* Interesting, in fact, neutral mutations are often used as evolutionary clocking mechanisms specifically because we can operate under the assumption they aren't subject to as much selective pressure, versus say, something critical to metabolism where a nonsyn mutation may very well be fatal.

&amp;#x200B;

* There are different kinds of selective pressure that may operate at different rates. Also you are assuming all mutations are point mutations. You are also assuming all change rates have to be identical.

&amp;#x200B;

* Subnote: The evolutionary model can and does adapt and change to incorporate new findings. That is how building good models works.

&amp;#x200B;

* I have no backing in geology so I'll let someone better with fossils take care of that.

&amp;#x200B;

* Okay, so if we all came from some perfect genomic template (...anyone else getting wierd eugenics vibes?) Can you reconstruct this template? Can you demonstrate how these changes were all distributed to see the genomic arrangements we see now? Also how on earth was this early population not more inbred than a CK2 run playing as the Paulicians?",Or you could actually read a biology textbook so you're not getting BS from deluded liars,Yes.,,,,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jn2_s_EpRII,

Check the churches in the New Testament. They are in Turkey (the 7 churches of Asia, the churches of Galatia, the church of Antioch...), Greece (the church of Athens, the church of Thessaloniki...), Italy (the church of Rome), and Palestine (the church of Jerusalem). If we account only for those communities that kept historical continuity with those early churches (so, if we put aside those churches that exist in those places but were established much later, or that consciously converted from one tradition to another)... the church of Rome is historically Catholic, and every other church is historically Orthodox (mostly Eastern Orthodox, although a couple, like Antioch, can be reasonably claimed by the Oriental Orthodox too).

Unless one believes in a ""great apostasy"", it only makes sense to join a church that has direct material, historical, geographical, cultural... continuity with the very churches of the New Testament. Or, if one does not live in those areas, then at least to join a church that is in communion with those churches.

But of course, those churches themselves aren't in agreement anymore, even though they used to be: now some are Catholic, some are Eastern Orthodox, some are Oriental Orthodox. Well... I would personally certainly rather trust those who still read the New Testament in its original language. So, the Greek Orthodox. It's not just about correctly understanding the text, but it's about a whole framework and manner of seeing things that is inherited from the Jews who read the Septuagint, and the apostles who wrote the New Testament, and the communities who received them... This isn't to claim that those who use Latin or Coptic or Ge'ez or Syriac are necessarily wrong (indeed, not even the Eastern Orthodox use Greek alone), but other languages are far more at risk of drifting away from the traditional understanding of the scriptures, and I think we especially see that today among anglophone Protestants.

So, because it has the strongest material, historical, geographical, cultural and linguistic continuity with the original Church Jesus built, I trust for now the Eastern Orthodox Church. But I'm also favorable to the Oriental Orthodox as dialogue in recent times was very encouraging. And I wouldn't outright discard the Roman Catholics (who can claim continuity with the New Testament's church of Rome, which both Peter and Paul visited and to whom Paul wrote an epistle), the Assyrian Church of the East (indeed, the prophet Isaiah prophesied there would be an altar to God in Egypt and in Assyria), and even the Orthodox Jews (who inherit the Hebraic and Aramaic tradition of the Old Testament, while the Greek Orthodox inherit the Greek and the Syriac and Assyrian churches inherit the Aramaic). But I cannot understand why someone who has read the Bible would want to belong to any other community, that has no continuity with the Bible at all except that they claim they know better than those who have always been studying it in ancient languages and cultural/religious frameworks.

TL;DR Read the New Testament, many of the churches in it still exist without any break of continuity and they are Orthodox (except for Rome). If you want to be a Christian, I'm not sure why you wouldn't want to start there","More important to find a church that follows gods word through and through. 

Even the same denominations believe in different things. Denominations doesn't matter. What matters is the churches doctrine and how they carry out Gods word","I am a member of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The word Orthodox comes from a Greek word with two meanings, ""Correct or Right Doctrine and Correct or Right Glory"".

We believe that we have obeyed the injunction of Jude 3 and have maintained without addition (like the Roman Catholics) or subtraction (like the Protestants) the faith that was handed down by our Lord to the Saints once for all.

Four out of five Patriarchs agree, that the Eastern Orthodox Church is the true Church.",,,,,,

You have a thought that bothers you in some way, then you have an emotional reaction about having the thought, prompting a deeper endocrine reaction, and then you feel even more anxiety about having an emotional response in your body. Spiral spiral spiral.

Just try letting thoughts come and go. You don't have to think about all of your thoughts. Your brain is a complex thing that runs thought experiments constantly. Some work some don't some are just nonsense.

Let me explain how your body and brain are put together very simply. The most primitive parts of your brain are the closest to the rest of your body through your nervous system. Like literally closest.

The way your brain is constructed I want you to put your fist in front of you and your arm is your spinal cord and your wrist is the base of your brain and now you're fist is the reptile part of your brain. Now over top of this are layers of your brain that become more complex but also further and further away from your primal systems.

Your primal or primitive systems do important work. They are what kept your ancestors alive so that way you can exist. They're doing nothing wrong.

The next layer of your brain becomes the animal brain, and then the next part of your brain on the way out is more your mammal brain, and then you start getting into your primate brain, then we start getting into your human brain. Then there's the human adult functional maturity that's the top part and the front of your brain, this is where complex sentient human thought and executive function are. This part of your brain is just starting to develop now in a serious way. It will continue to develop until you're close to your mid 20s. It's why you can have really complex ideas but then have a really hard time with controlling say really profound emotions. 

Your brain is a differential machine that tries things, sometimes they work, sometimes they fail, then it prunes the things that fail, and continues to put energy into the things that work. Sometimes the things that work work just because we're using them regularly, which isn't necessarily an indication that something that works is perfect. So sometimes we have to work too use our intention to replace things that work but maybe not as well as they could.

Okay the reason why this is important is that the further away something is from your primal systems means that a lot of times you have already started to have a reaction to something before it ever gets to your human brain for you to look at it. Your animal brain and your subconscious and your reptile brain and your endocrine system have already started to have a reaction. And then some of it gets to your human and prefrontal cortex, the part you kind of think of being really you. You, the more complex part of you, gets told last. It's at the end of the information Highway.

What is important about this is that this means that your primitive systems are doing their job the way they're supposed to be doing them, and your executive function is to analyze and then decide what needs to be addressed, and set out goals. It's kind of like a fire alarm goes off in your building and you kind of decide that that means you're a terrible person because the fire alarm is going off. But really the fire alarm is going off and now you have to make some decisions. Sometimes the fire alarm is going off I just have anything to do with you and it's just a test I was going to get turned off at a minute and you can really just ignore it. Someone already told you there was a test it happens. in your case you're young enough that some of the fire alarm systems are just being plugged into the main circuit board and they go off sometimes while that's happening as part of the test and those things just sometimes just don't work. It's a little bit annoying but there's no fire. Your circuit board is creating itself, and the things it most needs to create a good pathway are the things that challenge you. 

For the most part what we really do with it is we use our prefrontal cortex and our executive function to make stories about why the things that have already happened or have already started to happen are DESTINY. 

So instead of using our executive and prefrontal cortex for analyzing what happens and making decisions, we make up stories about why we're wrong or bad or powerless or right, because our primal systems are already reacting or our subconscious surfaces something to our regular awareness.

Basically there's a lot going on inside of your head all the time, and sometimes some of it comes up and you make decisions on it. And some of those are going to be thought experiments, or just random noise. Or even just practice runs for your primal primitive systems through to your prefrontal cortex for you to learn how to deal with them. Kind of like running a fire drill.

The good part about this is that it means that in your age group you're still learning how to think. Your mental processes are still very plastic, in that the neural pathways that you're creating are being created for the first time. And some of those neural pathways are going to work for a little while and then become obsolete, and some will fail and need to be replaced.

Try not to have a spiraling reaction to thoughts that you have. Just let them come and then let them go. Don't get caught into the process of having a strange thought experiment, and then wondering why you would do that, and then reacting emotionally to it, then your endocrine system like fires off, then you get mad at yourself about your endocrine system going off, and you think there's something wrong with you.......

Instead just let the thought come and then just let it go. 

And the good part about this is you're actually learning to calm down your system by doing this every time you choose to allow a thought to come and then not engaging it you're teaching your brain not to do that. It literally help you lay down neural pathways about how to cope with intrusive thoughts better.

Because everybody has weird thoughts it's just that not everybody cares.. so try to think of it as just being random noise some of it comes up, you let it go. It doesn't really mean anything. You don't need to let it mean anything. If you have a body reaction, take note but don't judge it. Your primitive systems are doing their job. You can just admire the work and not assess it is actionable. You don't have to do anything about it. 

God knows that we're a big pile of ordered chaos. It's what we choose to do with it that matters, and sometimes part of choosing is to choose to not engage and make something out of something that's just noise. Not judging your thoughts is also a choice. Just like you don't need to care about everything in your spam folder.

Give it a try.

[OH THAT RUGGED CROSS!](https://youtu.be/YHtEX1Eko_A)

**Isaiah 53**

""Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? 

He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and like a root out of dry ground.

He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.

He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.

Like one from whom people hide their faces he was despised, and we held him in low esteem.

Surely he took up our pain and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God, stricken by him, and afflicted.

But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed.

We all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way; and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.

He was oppressed and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not open his mouth.

By oppression and judgment he was taken away. 

Yet who of his generation protested?

For he was cut off from the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was punished.

He was assigned a grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death, though he had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth.

Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer, and though the Lord makes his life an offering for sin,
he will see his offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.

After he has suffered, he will see the light of life and be satisfied; by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many, and he will bear their iniquities.

Therefore I will give him a portion among the great, and he will divide the spoils with the strong, because he poured out his life unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors.

For he bore the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.",t2_7dhzp,False,,0,False,"Isaiah 53 - ""He was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar with pain.

I don't know why you would be in despair at the resurrection of Jesus being celebrated? Start with reading the joy of the resurrection in the bible and the miracle that it brought to human kind. Try focusing from the day Jesus entered Jerusalem on Palm Sunday and every day read those scriptures up to the crucifixion and resurrection. The falling of Peter the night before the crucifixion makes me realize how easily we can all fall in the face of evil.

Beautiful song.,"If you've never felt the rapture of salvation, how is it that you know you have been redeemed? Who can be caught up to heaven and not be in awe at the revealing of the Lord and of God the Father? 

Christ was perfected through suffering and suffering is the fruit of the wages of sin so God took Satan's fruit and made it the means by which we are perfected thereby defeating death once and for all. 

To counter death, those born in Christ have Everlasting Life within themselves. That means whether you are full or hungry, you'll have an abundance of Life. No need to be sad, you've overcome the world. His joy lives in you. 

Yes there's a lot going on in this world but in the world there is tribulation. In Christ, there is peace. This is true my friend. The world is on fire. Who can contain it? The flames don't burn if you're in Christ.",,,,,,

3Blessed are the poor in spirit,
    for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.
4Blessed are those who mourn,
    for they will be comforted.
5Blessed are the meek,
    for they will inherit the Earth.
6Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
    for they will be satisfied.
7Blessed are the merciful,

8Blessed are the pure in heart,

9Blessed are the peacemakers,

11Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of me. 
12Rejoice and be glad, because great is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you.

We have to remember that Jesus works in our pain and weaknesses, because this how he himself saved us it is in his greatest pain, by being torture and crucified on the cross that he saved us, this is the reason why this moment is called the passion of Christ, because not just during his pain but through his pain he still had passion for us, passion to save us, his greatest moment happened through his greatest pain by dying on the cross.

But then what happened after that? He conquered death and sin through his resurrection and in the same we are call to bear our daily cross so that in the same way we have our resurrection that he prepared for us","I'll be honest, my understanding about God is that his main priority isn't to make us happy, or bring us physical comfort in our life here. If you look in Scripture there is a lot of examples where being a follower of Christ is one of the most difficult things we can do on Earth. But going back to comfort, all of the New testament writers and the people that know Christ the most didn't live well physically. That's not to say that God isn't listening or doesn't care at all. One thing I have heard quite often and I've grown to believe is that when you feel that distance from God and you haven't sinned, it usually means he's working something out for you. During that time he rewards those who have blind Faith in him. Also God doesn't answer every single prayer, if it's not going to be something that's in his will but it's something that you want or you think you need, then he is less likely to answer that for you. I know it's not a really pleasant thing to read, but I promise you JC loves you and wants you.

447,,Christianity,"So first, some background info...

As a child, I was raised Christian and stayed that way until I was around 12 or 13. Since then, however, my faith began to dwindle until I was basically a nonbeliever. Recently, I've begun considering my place in this world and universe and have decided that I want to go back to God and believe in him and Christ like I once did.

I've been trying for a while now to get back into my faith, but I've been filled with doubts and fears about God such as ""what if he's not real?"" or ""what if I'm not one of his chosen few?"" 

Naturally I've also worried about what is after life then if these terrible doubts are true, whether that means that hell or nothingness lies in my future.

I've prayed about it and I'm currently reading the book of John to help with these worries and build my faith back up in God and, although that does help me a lot, I'm curious if these feelings are normal and if any of you blessed folks have some advice to
1.) help ease my doubts in God
2 ) help ease my fear of death 
3.) and help rebuild my faith back from the ground up.

Eventually, she started posting about Jesus again and deleted all her lustful and worldly posts. This may potentially indicate that she has in fact repented and God has brought her back to the faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, obviously I&amp;#39;m not sure about her life offline outside social media or whether her repentance is truly genuine. But from the surface, I have hopeful reason to suspect that she has indeed come back to the faith. If that&amp;#39;s the case, then Praise God and screw the devil.&lt;/p&gt;

""Doth not even nature itself teach you, that, if a man have long hair, it is a shame unto him?"" (KJV)

For context, I'm a 19 year old guy who's been growing my hair out since August, so it's relatively long right now. I went to church today, and one of the deacons playfully teased me by saying I should go to a barber. I chuckled at the joke, and then he brought up the verse.

After reading it, I'm now wondering what it means. I looked up the context, which still left me confused. Why does Paul condemn such a trivial thing like that? 

It left me feeling a bit upset and even a little angry quite frankly, because this is a deacon I grew up with, and he basically implied that because of something miniscule like the length of my hair, I'm a ""disgrace"" as Paul put it, completely disregarding the rest of my character.

My 15-year old brother offered an interesting take on it: that the whole context of chapter 11 is Paul pointing out traditional appearances and physical appearances for men and women, and being almost ironic and sarcastic to make a point about equity for men and women following Jesus, but I'm not sure how accurate that it.

Also, didn't Jesus have long hair? Wasn't Samson's long hair the source of his strength? Are these contradictions? 

Any discussion/input/opinion is welcome, and if it's really something that bad, I'll hit up a barber first thing this weekend.

Abraham bowed to the angels and addressed them with the singular ""Lord"".","Do you mind reading this short article on the Eastern Orthodox understanding of the Monarchy of the Father first? I ask because our view of the trinity is a little different from mainstream Roman Catholic and Protestant views that were popularized by the medevial Franks in their attempts to convert pagans.

https://www.sciencealert.com/we-just-got-even-more-evidence-that-ancient-earth-was-a-water-world

A very similar story is told to us in Genesis:

In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters...

...Then God said, “Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.” Thus God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were  above the firmament; and it was so. And God called the firmament Heaven. So the evening and the morning were the second day. Then God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear”; and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas. And God saw that it  was good.

I breathed a sigh of relief when I realized that he teaches SAC 101 Principles of Suretyship in Continuing Education for McMaster University.

In order to understand what's happening here, this is where we get into Ontario's education system. Through a combination of The Quebec Act guaranteeing the right for French settlers to remain Catholic, the Catholic Church's initiatives to build schools in colonial holdings and our general population makeup, we have a split education system. That is, we have a Public education system, and a Catholic education system for both primary and secondary students. They both report to the Ministry of Education, the only real difference being that one is secular, and the other is Catholic. You don't have to be Catholic to be part of the Catholic system, but expect to encounter Catholic things.

Canadian English-speaking Catholics are notably more... liberal than you'd probably expect. For instance, they don't uphold the ban on contraceptives that you find throughout most of the Catholic Church. They've apologized for the Residential Schooling system that stains our nation's history, while no Pope has. They're still definitely Catholic and aren't seen as heretics, but they're a bit of a unique animal compared to the stereotypes. Where they don't diverge is LGBTQ+ issues, where the Canadian Catholic Church firmly remains as a Side-B organization.

The video linked in the article is the professor's statement against affirming Pride Parades and the raising of the Pride Flag at Catholic schools.

If you watch the video (it's short), the professor cites the Catechism on homosexuality, which you'd expect in a Catholic school board meeting. At the end, he cites Matthew 18:6, which I'll cite from the NIV.

&gt; 6 “If anyone causes one of these little ones—those who believe in me—to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. 

To quote the article: Toronto City Coun. Kristyn Wong-Tam took to Twitter on March 5 to voice her displeasure.

&gt; 🚨  Yesterday this person spoke against rainbow flags in @TCDSB schools during Pride. If that doesn't get you, he ends his deputation by saying #LGBTQ2S allies should be killed by drowning. This is right before the Trustees vote.

&gt; # #DoBetter #HolyHaters

Toronto Police are now investigating if what he said is hate speech, and McMaster University is performing their own review.

My brief hot take. This is a complete overreaction, and standard for general offense taken from school board meetings in both the Public and Catholic boards. It's a literal scripture citation of why people shouldn't mislead children, from the professor's perspective, away from Catholic doctrine, which he believes to be truth. This is not a death threat, hate speech or call to action, it's a literal citation of scripture in a Catholic school board meeting.

Church and state has always been a bit murky with the Catholic School Board, but oh boy does this feel like a reach to get angry about something. The Catholic Board, and Catholics have Creed (religion) human rights like every other person, and those are traditionally what win out in these cases. Worse, this just seems like intentional controversy to try to punish a professor, who we may disagree with, for speaking orthodoxy from the largest branch in Christianity.

This whole thing is silly, and will likely result in nothing.","I’m curious how many would react if a Muslim teacher quoted a Hadith about killing infidels at a schoolboard meeting (and then potentially backtracked and said it’s only metaphorical), if they’d get the same benefit of the doubt.","I think he's *wrong*, obviously, but calling that ""hate speech"" is a huge and stupid overreaction.

I guess they're freaking out at the ""millstone"" verse?

491,,Christianity,"Hello friends,

My wife and I have been attending our church for about three months now and we have found it to be a great experience. For a little background this is the first church we have attended together since getting married and giving our lives to the Lord so everything feels quite new for us both.

We both had recently come together to discuss a minor personal issue with what we assume is how the church is using it's tithe money. Since we began attending, the church has been giving away Starbucks gift cards for new members and this has felt wrong to both my wife and I. We have been tithing just after we started attending this church and for the first time today we both discussed how weird it feels of the church making these announcements every sunday about giving gift cards to people. Presumably these gift cards are purchased with the tithe money, and we find that to be an issue.

This issue felt like it became amplified after I personally met with my pastor in an attempt to seek to expand my own involvement and role within the church, and I was loosely advocating to initiate starting a sort of outreach program for the poor, specifically the homeless of our area. When I attempted to pursue this discussion, it felt as though my pastor pivoted the conversation to me personally and it suddenly became about me not working for ""fulfilling my role as the head of my household."" My pastor asked me what I did for work, and in truth I've spent all winter researching and studying for some books I plan to write but since I currently wasn't generating income he literally made a comment that I should ""be working 40 or more hours a week.""  My wife and I have our own window washing company that slows to stand still during the winter but we both do odd jobs here and there to get by, and by the grace of God we have made it by each month to not only pay rent but to tithe, and pursue our own personal projects and pursuits.

This all felt very strange because I was interested in attempting to create a dialogue on outreach for the homeless and or substance abuse, voluntarily. Ironically enough he said I should go work for a local homeless shelter he knew of, of course getting paid and working full time there. I don't want to be paid to help those the Lord has placed on my heart.

When I brought this up to my wife she was agreeing with me that it seemed very misguided on our pastors part, and she too felt that our pastor on a personal level, wasn't quite as present as he could be so she had been praying for him. She had talked on the phone with him discussing baptism, just wanting to learn more about it and he seemingly completely forgot what they had discussed and she felt as though he didn't retain anything she opened up to him about prior. She had to bring the topic up with him again, and when she did it was as if they never had discussed it which bothered her. We both sympathized though knowing he talks to many people in the church and I felt as though she was doing great by giving those small issues up to the Lord in prayer.

If this church is doing outreach that we just haven't heard about, they are very quiet about it and have not promoted it in the three months we have been there. Our last prayer meeting they discussed forming a softball team, but nothing of the sort of reaching out to others who aren't already involved in the church.

Apparently the word homosexual never appeared in the bible until much much later?


Here’s a quote from  site
https://um-insight.net/perspectives/has-“homosexual”-always-been-in-the-bible/

If you would like, I would love if someone could read the article as well and tell me what they think, but I’m not expecting you to I included a quote below anyways.

“I started collecting old Bibles in French, German, Irish, Gaelic, Czechoslovakian, Polish… you name it. Now I’ve got most European major languages that I’ve collected over time. Anyway, I had a German friend come back to town and I asked if he could help me with some passages in one of my German Bibles from the 1800s. So we went to Leviticus 18:22 and he’s translating it for me word for word. In the English where it says “Man shall not lie with man, for it is an abomination,” the German version says “Man shall not lie with young boys as he does with a woman, for it is an abomination.” I said, “What?! Are you sure?” He said, “Yes!” Then we went to Leviticus 20:13— same thing, “Young boys.” So we went to 1 Corinthians to see how they translated arsenokoitai (original Greek word)  and instead of homosexuals it said, “Boy molesters will not inherit the kingdom of God.” 

It seems with most of the verses talking about homosexuality was actually talking about pedophaelia.

Others talked about how these verses were from the Old Testament, where you also weren’t allowed to do many things we do today, and having gay sex could be dangerous or something. So it kept people safe, just like when we weren’t allowed to eat pork I think. Not very educated on that part though.

Yes, the English word “homosexuals” was added to the Bible for the first time in 1946, but previous translations and commentators always took those prohibitions to at least include same-sex sexual activity. 

The author *is* right that “homosexuals” is a bad translation, because sexual orientation is a modern scientific theory that shouldn’t be read into the first century. 

But okay, if Paul isn’t condemning “homosexuals” but just same-sex sexual activity.... that doesn’t get the gay-affirming Christian very far. 

But it might be a first step to showing the great historical gulf between modern theories about sexuality and ancient theories on sexuality. And that gulf is key to the gay-affirming Christians’ most rigorous (IMO) arguments. Plenty of Biblical prohibitions and stories and theories, conservatives can chalk up to historical context. We just need to get same-sex relations into that same bucket.","It is true that in Luther's Bible he translated Leviticus 20:13 and 1 Corinthians 6:9 to refer to people sleeping with boys (knaben) rather than men.  This might be an issue of 16th century German having different meanings than 21st century German, or it might simply be a mistranslation.  The latter seems plausible, as Luther would have been familiar with the Greek practice of pederasty, but may have been less familiar with adult homosexual relationships.

It is simply this:

Prayer is asking from God what He has promised in His Word, knowing that God always keeps His promises.

What is Gods promise concerning prayer?  Consider Psa 50:15 (ESV):

&gt; and call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver you, and you shall glorify me.

From [The Lutheran Study Bible](http://www.cph.org/t-tlsb.aspx)

&gt; 50:15 *call upon Me*. See here. All our acts of worship and our entire lives are now offered to and accepted by God through His Son, the personal Savior whom we call upon in times of trouble, and who, without condition, promises to deliver us (cf Heb 13:15). *glorify Me*. Glorifying is never our work, but calling upon God and receiving His deliverance in thanksgiving (faith!) is the worship that glorifies Him. (See note, vv 13–14.) “God wants Himself to be known, He wants Himself to be worshiped, so that we receive benefits from Him and receive them because of His mercy, not because of our merits” (Ap IV 60; see XXIV 29).

It is a gift from God for our benefit that He uses to create and maintain our faith.

Consider 1 John 5:14-15 (ESV) 

&gt; And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us. And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him.

Also consider 2 Cor 12:8-9 (ESV)

&gt; Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.

God answers every prayer. His answer is always “Yes” because as Christians we always pray that all things will be done according to His Will. And, He will always do that which is according to His Will.

If you want all of the details, I suggest reading:

[Theology and Practice of Prayer: A Lutheran View](https://www.lcms.org/Document.fdoc?src=lcm&amp;id=2355)

From [The Lutheran Study Bible](http://www.cph.org/t-tlsb.aspx)

John 14:14:

&gt; 14:14 *in My name, I will do it*. Not simply a formula appended to a prayer, but prayer in keeping with Jesus’ revealed will and teaching. Cf Jas 4:3.

James 4:3 (ESV)

&gt; You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.

From [The Lutheran Study Bible](http://www.cph.org/t-tlsb.aspx)

&gt; 4:3 *you ask wrongly*. Not that the wrong words are used but that the motive is selfish, seeking only worldly treasures. Instead of selfish prayer, intercessory prayer for others is encouraged (5:14–15). James is not developing a complete theology of prayer but demonstrating that people without wisdom from God cannot pray properly.

Mark 11:22-24 (ESV)

&gt; 22And Jesus answered them, “Have faith in God. 23Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and thrown into the sea,’ and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. 24Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours.

From [The Lutheran Study Bible](http://www.cph.org/t-tlsb.aspx)

&gt; 11:22–24 Jesus explains that the source of His authority is God, who gives faith and honors prayers spoken in faith. See notes, Jas 5:15–18.

&gt; 11:20–26 Jesus teaches that saving faith rescues us from God’s judgment and that, through faith, we have the power to do the work God gives us. Without faith in Jesus, it is impossible to please God or pray to Him. We know God hears our prayers even if we do not receive an answer immediately. Confident prayer, based on faith in Christ crucified and risen, trusts God to answer in His own time and way (cf Rm 8:32). • “Forgive our sins, Lord, we implore, That they may trouble us no more; We, too, will gladly those forgive Who hurt us by the way they live. Help us in our community To serve each other willingly.” Amen. (LSB 766:6)","Prayer is predominantly about aligning ourselves with God's will, not the other way around.","Prayer isn't an incantation to get stuff from genie God. It's a relationship with God and the number 1 way people grow in a relationship is through talking. You learn Lot by watching how another person acts but you get to know the intentions and plans and motivations of why someone acts how they do by learning about them through talking with them. Most of prayer is that, talking with God. Giving voice to your needs and wants sure but also your fears, worries, anxieties, joys, humor, angers and so on and also any doubts or thanks and praises. You learn as much about yourself as you do God through reading the Bible and prayer. Prayer isn't about getting God to line up to your will, its about learning and aligning yourself with his will.

 Of course He knows what we need but by bringing our needs, along with everything else, to Him we are acknowledging that he is our Father and we rely on him alone, and if he decides to act on our prayer (the answer can be no of course) then we become a part of that work. Like he let's us be a part of what He could do alone, because he loves us that much.",,,,,,
496,,Christianity,"In the beginning, God created the universe. Adam and Eve, who were supposed to have dominion over the Earth, sinned against God by eating fruit from a forbidden tree, which gave the rights of the world over to Satan, a fallen angel who had rebelled against God. Sin entered the world and humanity was chased Adam and Eve from the Garden of Eden. Later they had two sons, Cain and Abel, the latter of which was killed by his jealous brother. As the world began to populate with humanity, sin flourished and ultimately God decided to start over. He saved those faithful to him, only Noah and his family, along with many pairs of animals, and flooded the whole world, leaving Noah and his family to repopulate it afterwards.

Yet as humanity flourished again, so did sin. The king of Babel wanted to build a tower that would reach into heaven for political and militaristic purposes. God was offended that humanity was trying to walk into his domain and confused their language, which is why the abomination that is French exists (if anyone here is French, please know that I'm joking). God showed Abraham a land where he wanted him to go, Canaan, and Abraham took his tribe and went there. Lot, his nephew, moved away to a city that was burned by God's wrath, but managed to escape. His wife was so salty about her home being destroyed that she actually turned into salt. After many years of waiting, Abraham had a son named Isaac, who he once attempted to sacrifice on God's orders. At the last second, God stopped him and blessed him for his faith. Abraham's descendants, the Jews, are as numerous as the stars in the sky, as God had promised him. After Isaac got married, Abraham died.

Isaac had two sons named Esau and Jacob. When Jacob tricked Esau out of his birthright, and Jacob's mother Rebekah tricked Isaac, now old and blind, into giving Jacob that birthright by mistake. Esau was furious and Jacob ran away to his uncle, who he loved with for years, marrying two women, taking on a few mistresses, and having twelve sons. Jacob's favorite was Joseph. His brothers got jealous of him and threw him in a well before selling him to traders on their way to Egypt, where Joseph served as a slave, was thrown in jail, and then interpreted the pharaoh's weird dreams. A famine struck and Joseph's strategic mind along with some help from God led to Egypt getting rich when everyone else came to them for food, including Joseph's brothers. After screwing around with them for a while, Joseph revealed who he was. The entire family came to live in Egypt, and they all died there. Then the pharaoh enslaved their descendants, the Jews.

The Jews didn't like being enslaved however. Eventually Moses, a Jew himself, came to free them. The pharaoh was reluctant at first, but after Egypt was brought to its knees with plagues he agreed to let them go. The Egyptians regretted their decision though and tried to enslave them again but God drowned them all. The Jews went to a mountain where Moses received the Commandments, but when he came down he saw the Jews worshiping an idol. He had the unrepentant ones killed and then got a new copy of the Commandments before walking to Canaan for the next 40 years. Moses died and Joshua led the Jews through Canaan, carving out a land for them in Canaan called Israel. Then he died. Following Joshua, a series of judges were sent by God to deliver the Jews from their enemies whenever they fell into sin. Then the Jews asked the prophet Samuel for a king like other countries, and God gave them Saul.

Saul was cool at first, but then he stopped being faithful to God and God abandoned him. He was tormented by an inner demon that only David's music calmed. The Philistines were dominating the Jews in a war, but when David killed Goliath the giant, he became a hero to Israel. In fact, he became more popular than Saul, and Saul tried to kill him. However he eventually had bigger fish to fry. When the Philistines attacked, Saul had a witch raise Samuel from the dead to ask for help, but Samuel noped out of there and Saul killed himself in battle. David became king, and lusted after Bathsheba, having her husband Uriah killed in action. As a result God killed David's first child by Bathsheba. Eventually, God forgave him and allowed his next son, Solomon, to survive. David had many children, but the oldest was Amnon. Amnon raped his sister Tamar, Absalom killed Amnon, and David banished Absalom. Absalom was eventually allowed to return, and he rallied support before starting a civil war.

During that civil war Absalom had a bad hair day when his hair got caught in a tree, and Joab, David's general, killed him. Years later, when David was old, Adonijah declared himself king, and David had Solomon anointed. Solomon spared Adonijah's life but later had both Adonijah and Joab killed. Solomon was a wise king after David died, and he worshiped God. Because of this God granted him wisdom, which Solomon used to advance Israel's position in the world. He also built a temple in Jerusalem. Israel became rich. But the women who Solomon kept in his court were pagans who worshiped idols, and eventually they convinced Solomon to do the same. So God abandoned Solomon, who died and was succeeded by his son Rehoboam, who was idiotic enough to cause a civil war which divided Israel into Israel and Judah. Jeroboam became king of Judah while Rehoboam remained king of Israel. Judah was bigger.

Years passed and Ahab and Jezebel came to rule Israel, and they sucked because they killed the prophets. So God sent Elijah, one of his last prophets, to preach against them. He did so, and he gave the monarchy a hard time. Ahab was later killed in battle as Elijah prophesied, and Jezebel was the sole ruler of Israel. Her son was a puppet, let's be honest. However Jehu led a rebellion against Jezebel and pushed her out of a window. Elijah was taken up to heaven and Elisha was given the ability to do miracles like Elijah. For example, he had bears kill teenagers who were bullying him for being bald. Jehu launched a crusade to kill everyone in Ahab's family and became king of Israel. Meanwhile in Judah, Queen Athaliah was being wicked. When her grandson Josiah was old enough, the priests anointed him as king of Judah and Athaliah was killed.

The Jews abandoned God again, and so God sent Isaiah to prophesy that Jerusalem would be destroyed, but that there would be a messiah for Israel and the world. Josiah was a good king for the most part, and around this time Jeremiah was being a prophet. The two met each other and Josiah originally listened to Jeremiah, but then he decided to attack Egypt and was killed in action. Jeremiah and his companion Baruch were then persecuted by Josiah's successors until Babylon took over Israel, destroyed the temple and held the Jews in exile for 70 years. During this time, Nebuchadnezzar tried to burn Meshach, Shadrach, and Abednego for not worshiping him, but God saved them. Daniel also interpreted Nebuchadnezzar's dreams. Then Nebuchadnezzar lost his mind for a little while and lived in the wilderness. When he returned to Babylon, he submitted to God. Then he died and his grandson Belshazzar became king. Belshazzar was an absolute nullifidian (look it up). He used the treasures from God's old temple as utensils.

This made God angry, so he decided to write some funny words on Belshazzar's wall. Belshazzar called for Daniel, who said that God had grown tired of Belshazzar's shenanigans and that Belshazzar would die. Then Persia took over Babylon and Belshazzar was killed. King Darius of Persia liked Daniel and made him his chief advisor. The other advisors got jealous and tricked Darius into making a decree saying that he was basically God for a month. Daniel didn't obey this decree and Darius was forced to throw him into the lion's den. God saved him though and Darius put the jealous advisors into the lion's den. And this time God wasn't so kind. Darius passed another decree that God is God, and Darius was not God. Then afterwards, Cyrus became king of Persia and let the Jews go home to Israel. By this time Daniel was very old and he died in Babylon.

It took time, but with the help of prophets like Ezra, Haggai and Malachi, the Jews rebuilt their temple. Then Alexander the Great took over most of the civilized world, including Israel, and then ten seconds later Alexander the Dead's empire was divided among his generals. Years later Antiochus was the pagan king of the Seleucid Empire which included Israel. The Maccabeans revolted and Israel was freed. A century later, Pompey, who was fighting for the Roman Republic took over Israel and ransacked Jerusalem. Jokes on Pompey though because he was killed in Egypt years later. Then Herod was appointed by the Roman Senate as the puppet king of Israel, and he built a temple even more beautiful than Solomon. His building projects drained the economy though and he was very harsh on his subjects. This led to the Jews crying out for a messiah.

A star appeared in the night sky, which was read by astrologers as the coming of the messiah. An angel announced to a woman named Mary that she would bear this messiah, and convinced Joseph to marry her, which he did. Then Augustus called for a census throughout the Roman Empire, and in a stable in Bethlehem they have birth to Jesus. Herod was so paranoid that he massacred Bethlehem. Jesus, Mary and Joseph fled to Egypt until Herod died. When he was an adult, Jesus went down to the Jordan River, where his cousin John was baptizing people to repent. John baptized Jesus reluctantly before Jesus went into the desert and resisted temptations by Satan. Then he went back to civilization and gathered twelve disciples and performed many miracles. His popularity grew drastically enough to attract the attention of the Jewish leaders, who criticized Jesus constantly. Jesus exposed them as liars and hypocrites and told many parables.

The Jews eventually turned against Jesus and had him crucified, which as many prophets foretold opened the doors to salvation. Three days later he came back and ascended to heaven in front of 500 people. Those people then went on to spread Christianity throughout the world. There were those who persecuted them however, and all but one of the disciples of Jesus met a gruesome death. Meanwhile, people like Paul were the driving forces that kept Christianity alive. John was banished to the island of Patmos by the Roman Emperor Domitian for refusing to acknowledge him as a god. There, he received one last vision from Jesus and wrote the Book of Revelation and sent it off to seven churches in Asia Minor.",t2_9n0pix4r,False,,0,False,A Summary of The Bible,[],r/Christianity,False,7,,0,,False,t3_m23ulg,False,dark,0.82,,public,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1615427819.0,text,7,,,text,self.Christianity,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the beginning, God created the universe.

When Jacob tricked Esau out of his birthright, and Jacob&amp;#39;s mother Rebekah tricked Isaac, now old and blind, into giving Jacob that birthright by mistake. Esau was furious and Jacob ran away to his uncle, who he loved with for years, marrying two women, taking on a few mistresses, and having twelve sons. Jacob&amp;#39;s favorite was Joseph. His brothers got jealous of him and threw him in a well before selling him to traders on their way to Egypt, where Joseph served as a slave, was thrown in jail, and then interpreted the pharaoh&amp;#39;s weird dreams. A famine struck and Joseph&amp;#39;s strategic mind along with some help from God led to Egypt getting rich when everyone else came to them for food, including Joseph&amp;#39;s brothers. After screwing around with them for a while, Joseph revealed who he was. The entire family came to live in Egypt, and they all died there. Then the pharaoh enslaved their descendants, the Jews.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jews didn&amp;#39;t like being enslaved however. Eventually Moses, a Jew himself, came to free them. The pharaoh was reluctant at first, but after Egypt was brought to its knees with plagues he agreed to let them go. The Egyptians regretted their decision though and tried to enslave them again but God drowned them all. The Jews went to a mountain where Moses received the Commandments, but when he came down he saw the Jews worshiping an idol. He had the unrepentant ones killed and then got a new copy of the Commandments before walking to Canaan for the next 40 years. Moses died and Joshua led the Jews through Canaan, carving out a land for them in Canaan called Israel. Then he died. Following Joshua, a series of judges were sent by God to deliver the Jews from their enemies whenever they fell into sin. Then the Jews asked the prophet Samuel for a king like other countries, and God gave them Saul.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saul was cool at first, but then he stopped being faithful to God and God abandoned him. He was tormented by an inner demon that only David&amp;#39;s music calmed. The Philistines were dominating the Jews in a war, but when David killed Goliath the giant, he became a hero to Israel. In fact, he became more popular than Saul, and Saul tried to kill him. However he eventually had bigger fish to fry. When the Philistines attacked, Saul had a witch raise Samuel from the dead to ask for help, but Samuel noped out of there and Saul killed himself in battle. David became king, and lusted after Bathsheba, having her husband Uriah killed in action. As a result God killed David&amp;#39;s first child by Bathsheba. Eventually, God forgave him and allowed his next son, Solomon, to survive. David had many children, but the oldest was Amnon. Amnon raped his sister Tamar, Absalom killed Amnon, and David banished Absalom. Absalom was eventually allowed to return, and he rallied support before starting a civil war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During that civil war Absalom had a bad hair day when his hair got caught in a tree, and Joab, David&amp;#39;s general, killed him. Years later, when David was old, Adonijah declared himself king, and David had Solomon anointed. Solomon spared Adonijah&amp;#39;s life but later had both Adonijah and Joab killed. Solomon was a wise king after David died, and he worshiped God. Because of this God granted him wisdom, which Solomon used to advance Israel&amp;#39;s position in the world. He also built a temple in Jerusalem. Israel became rich. But the women who Solomon kept in his court were pagans who worshiped idols, and eventually they convinced Solomon to do the same. So God abandoned Solomon, who died and was succeeded by his son Rehoboam, who was idiotic enough to cause a civil war which divided Israel into Israel and Judah. Jeroboam became king of Judah while Rehoboam remained king of Israel. Judah was bigger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Years passed and Ahab and Jezebel came to rule Israel, and they sucked because they killed the prophets. So God sent Elijah, one of his last prophets, to preach against them. He did so, and he gave the monarchy a hard time. Ahab was later killed in battle as Elijah prophesied, and Jezebel was the sole ruler of Israel. Her son was a puppet, let&amp;#39;s be honest. However Jehu led a rebellion against Jezebel and pushed her out of a window. Elijah was taken up to heaven and Elisha was given the ability to do miracles like Elijah. For example, he had bears kill teenagers who were bullying him for being bald. Jehu launched a crusade to kill everyone in Ahab&amp;#39;s family and became king of Israel. Meanwhile in Judah, Queen Athaliah was being wicked. When her grandson Josiah was old enough, the priests anointed him as king of Judah and Athaliah was killed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jews abandoned God again, and so God sent Isaiah to prophesy that Jerusalem would be destroyed, but that there would be a messiah for Israel and the world. Josiah was a good king for the most part, and around this time Jeremiah was being a prophet. The two met each other and Josiah originally listened to Jeremiah, but then he decided to attack Egypt and was killed in action. Jeremiah and his companion Baruch were then persecuted by Josiah&amp;#39;s successors until Babylon took over Israel, destroyed the temple and held the Jews in exile for 70 years. During this time, Nebuchadnezzar tried to burn Meshach, Shadrach, and Abednego for not worshiping him, but God saved them. Daniel also interpreted Nebuchadnezzar&amp;#39;s dreams. Then Nebuchadnezzar lost his mind for a little while and lived in the wilderness. When he returned to Babylon, he submitted to God. Then he died and his grandson Belshazzar became king. Belshazzar was an absolute nullifidian (look it up). He used the treasures from God&amp;#39;s old temple as utensils.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made God angry, so he decided to write some funny words on Belshazzar&amp;#39;s wall. Belshazzar called for Daniel, who said that God had grown tired of Belshazzar&amp;#39;s shenanigans and that Belshazzar would die. Then Persia took over Babylon and Belshazzar was killed. King Darius of Persia liked Daniel and made him his chief advisor. The other advisors got jealous and tricked Darius into making a decree saying that he was basically God for a month. Daniel didn&amp;#39;t obey this decree and Darius was forced to throw him into the lion&amp;#39;s den. God saved him though and Darius put the jealous advisors into the lion&amp;#39;s den. And this time God wasn&amp;#39;t so kind. Darius passed another decree that God is God, and Darius was not God. Then afterwards, Cyrus became king of Persia and let the Jews go home to Israel. By this time Daniel was very old and he died in Babylon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It took time, but with the help of prophets like Ezra, Haggai and Malachi, the Jews rebuilt their temple. Then Alexander the Great took over most of the civilized world, including Israel, and then ten seconds later Alexander the Dead&amp;#39;s empire was divided among his generals. Years later Antiochus was the pagan king of the Seleucid Empire which included Israel. The Maccabeans revolted and Israel was freed. A century later, Pompey, who was fighting for the Roman Republic took over Israel and ransacked Jerusalem. Jokes on Pompey though because he was killed in Egypt years later. Then Herod was appointed by the Roman Senate as the puppet king of Israel, and he built a temple even more beautiful than Solomon. His building projects drained the economy though and he was very harsh on his subjects. This led to the Jews crying out for a messiah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A star appeared in the night sky, which was read by astrologers as the coming of the messiah. An angel announced to a woman named Mary that she would bear this messiah, and convinced Joseph to marry her, which he did. Then Augustus called for a census throughout the Roman Empire, and in a stable in Bethlehem they have birth to Jesus. Herod was so paranoid that he massacred Bethlehem. Jesus, Mary and Joseph fled to Egypt until Herod died. When he was an adult, Jesus went down to the Jordan River, where his cousin John was baptizing people to repent. John baptized Jesus reluctantly before Jesus went into the desert and resisted temptations by Satan. Then he went back to civilization and gathered twelve disciples and performed many miracles. His popularity grew drastically enough to attract the attention of the Jewish leaders, who criticized Jesus constantly. Jesus exposed them as liars and hypocrites and told many parables.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Jews eventually turned against Jesus and had him crucified, which as many prophets foretold opened the doors to salvation. Three days later he came back and ascended to heaven in front of 500 people. Those people then went on to spread Christianity throughout the world. There were those who persecuted them however, and all but one of the disciples of Jesus met a gruesome death. Meanwhile, people like Paul were the driving forces that kept Christianity alive. John was banished to the island of Patmos by the Roman Emperor Domitian for refusing to acknowledge him as a god. There, he received one last vision from Jesus and wrote the Book of Revelation and sent it off to seven churches in Asia Minor.&lt;/p&gt;

513,,Christianity," 

In the year 313, the Emperor Constantine had issued an edict granting Christians religious freedom, and officially recognizing Christianity as equal with paganism under the law. The eastern provinces had been entrusted to Licinius who had the half-sister of Constantine. Their marriage was the occasion for the jointly-issued ""Edict of Milan"" that allowed Christianity (and any religion one might choose) to be professed in the Empire, with additional dispositions that restored confiscated properties to Christian congregations and exempted Christian clergy from municipal civic duties. But a year later civil war erupted between Licinius and Constantine and as part of Constantine's attempts to decrease Licinius's popularity, he actively portrayed his brother-in-law as a pagan supporter. Beyond the propaganda, it is clear that Licinius had re-affirmed the rights of Christians in his half of the empire but later in his life turned against them and back to paganism. Today the eastern church remembers how in 320, forty young Christian Roman soldiers were from the 12th Legion, who had refused to sacrifice to idols, were tried before the tribunal at Sebaste, Cappadocia. The governor tried threats, bribery, and torture to persuade the young men, but they stood firm. He put the forty in prison, where it is said that Christ appeared and encouraged them to persevere.  
All forty signed a will, drafted by the youngest soldier St. Meletius, that expressed their faith, unity, and courage: *When we by God’s grace and the common prayers of all shall furnish the strife set before us, and come to the rewards of the high calling, we desire that then this will of ours may be respected . . .For although we come from different localities, we have chosen one and the same resting-place because we have set before ourselves one common strife for the prize. These things have seemed good to the Holy Spirit and have pleased us. Therefore we . . . brothers in Christ beseech our honoured parents and relatives to have no grief or distress, but to respect the decision of our brotherly fellowship, and to consent heartily to our wishes, so that you may receive from our common Father the great recompense of obedience and of sharing in our sufferings. . . .We pray with our souls and with the Divine Spirit that we may all obtain the eternal good things of God and his kingdom, now and forever and ever. Amen*.  
They were killed near the city of Sebaste, in Lesser Armenia (present-day Sivas in Turkey), and the earliest account of their existence and martyrdom is given by Bishop Basil of Caesarea. Through him we are told that, incensed by the soldiers’ obstinacy, the governor ordered them to be stripped and left to die standing on a frozen lake. In a cruel attempt to soften their resolve, he arranged a fire and warm bath on the shore to tempt them to apostatize. After one night’s ordeal, however, one soldier caved in, but died of extreme heat in the bath. An off-duty guard, Aggias , prompted by the courage and a dream, professed himself a Christian and took his place. After three days the governor had the survivors’ limbs broken and their bodies burned and had the ashes of the forty martyrs scattered into a river, but some were allegedly secured and became treasured relics.  
The deaths of The Forty Martyrs has attracted both veneration and art until the present day. One of the oldest images we have is painted on a wooden icon from the 4th century. It shows forty naked, pale, shivering, stoical young men crowded together and can be seen in the Musee des Beaux Arts in Paris. The Forum in Rome has a small building called the Oratory of the Forty Martyrs. Dating from the 600’s, its walls are frescoed with the slim bodies of the young men whose arms are raised in praise. And early images can be found in catacombs in Sicily. A Church dedicated to them can be found in Sugarland Texas, and is part of the Antiochian Orthodox Christian Archdiocese of North America. And there is a pious custom of baking “skylarks” in Christian Orthodox families on this day, either of pastries shaped like skylarks or a simple Lenten bread if today falls into the Lenten season. In some countries, for a long while, people believed that birds sing at this time to announce the arrival of spring and in honour of the Forty Martyrs.

If they then reject it I guess they're going to hell like us Atheists.,"From the Catechism of the Catholic Church: 

846 How are we to understand this affirmation, often repeated by the Church Fathers?335 Re-formulated positively, it means that all salvation comes from Christ the Head through the Church which is his Body:

Basing itself on Scripture and Tradition, the Council teaches that the Church, a pilgrim now on earth, is necessary for salvation: the one Christ is the mediator and the way of salvation; he is present to us in his body which is the Church. He himself explicitly asserted the necessity of faith and Baptism, and thereby affirmed at the same time the necessity of the Church which men enter through Baptism as through a door. Hence they could not be saved who, knowing that the Catholic Church was founded as necessary by God through Christ, would refuse either to enter it or to remain in it.336

847 This affirmation is not aimed at those who, through no fault of their own, do not know Christ and his Church:

Those who, through no fault of their own, do not know the Gospel of Christ or his Church, but who nevertheless seek God with a sincere heart, and, moved by grace, try in their actions to do his will as they know it through the dictates of their conscience - those too may achieve eternal salvation.337

848 ""Although in ways known to himself God can lead those who, through no fault of their own, are ignorant of the Gospel, to that faith without which it is impossible to please him, the Church still has the obligation and also the sacred right to evangelize all men.""338

Mission - a requirement of the Church's catholicity

849 The missionary mandate. ""Having been divinely sent to the nations that she might be 'the universal sacrament of salvation,' the Church, in obedience to the command of her founder and because it is demanded by her own essential universality, strives to preach the Gospel to all men"":339 ""Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and Lo, I am with you always, until the close of the age.""340

850 The origin and purpose of mission. the Lord's missionary mandate is ultimately grounded in the eternal love of the Most Holy Trinity: ""The Church on earth is by her nature missionary since, according to the plan of the Father, she has as her origin the mission of the Son and the Holy Spirit.""341 The ultimate purpose of mission is none other than to make men share in the communion between the Father and the Son in their Spirit of love.342",Amen.,,,,,,

If cutting meat and or dairy from your diet will contribute to an eating disorder, its no problem to fast from other things.

This winter I fasted from heat throught it more than particular foods for better or for worse, being away from the seasons of the divine liturgy makes it difficult to fast according to a calendar in my experience. 

But fasting from warmth proved to be a rather beneficial thing and actually kind of teaches you to fast in general. 

But fasting from social media, TV, sitting down all day, ect are all things to consider.","I never had an eating disorder, but I don’t fast from food because I have anemia. In general I don’t advise practicing anything that could be detrimental to your health. That includes anyone with a history of eating disorders. 

Now, if you can’t fast from food for health reasons, you can still practice “fasting” beyond food. However, I see a lot of Christians “fasting” from chocolate, social media, TV, or something like that — I don’t believe this is truly fasting. It’s just dieting and practicing self-discipline. Still can be a good thing but not exactly the spiritual practice that fasting is supposed to be. The only instance I can I think of where fasting goes beyond food in the Bible is in Isaiah 58:6-7. So if you are to practice fasting beyond food, consider these verses and how they could guide your practice.",,,,,,

It's really hard to tell the difference between an actual call to preach, and sincere wishful thinking. Being a pastor is heavy stuff and it shouldn't be taken lightly. In my opinion, you need to _know_ this is your path, not just _want_ it to be your path. You say you have an insatiable desire that will not relent, but you're also asking for clarity from strangers so it sounds like you're still a bit conflicted or unsure.

You have your whole life ahead of you, you don't have to set your life's final course right now. Don't stop studying and praying, and in the meantime enjoy your life as you work toward your goals. If this is truly what you are meant to do, clarity will come, with or without the prayers of others.

There are small denominations consisting of a single congregation or a single person with their own shared confession who have chosen to separate themselves from the wider church. It is not always easy to determine what these denominations believe, teach, accept, and reject.

We are called by Scripture to unity and to share a common confession. There is one God. God does not change. His Word has not changed. There is one truth as revealed in Scripture and that truth is knowable by us.

From the LCMS FAQ:

[Q:  I am confused regarding so many denominations that exist. Appreciate if you could provide advice regarding the biblical and theological teaching for the following: ""Some say that the existence of denominations within Christ's church is a tragedy caused by sin and immaturity; others claim that denominations are a blessing, since they produce diversity within the body of Christ."" What do you think?](http://www.lcms.org/faqs/denominations#denominations)

A:  Since apostolic times visible Christendom has been divided. Although there are historical, cultural, and sociological factors that have contributed to such division, departure from God's truth revealed to us in the Holy Scriptures must be regarded as the principal cause for such division. The apostles themselves foresaw and had to deal with such division within early Christian communities (see, for example, Acts 20:25-31). While the Scriptures are the inerrant source and norm of all doctrine and while God's Truth is one, sinful human beings can and do err. Hence, division occurs in visible Christendom.
The same can be said for modern denominationalism. While there are historical, cultural and sociological factors involved in the formation of denominations, disagreement regarding the understanding and application of biblical doctrine remains the fundamental reason for division between and among them. We hold that there can be only one Truth, and that denominations exist because some Christians have departed from what is faithful to biblical doctrine. In spite of the divided state of Christendom, we in The Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod remain committed to the quest for external unity in the church based on agreement in doctrine. We believe that this is not an option, but is God's will.","not necessarily, but the vast mainstream of Christianity are in denominational groups. while nondenominational churches exist, they have two issues: first, they're not as diverse in worship or doctrine as you might think, their reputation is ""Independent Baptists in denial"". the other issue is they have little downward accountability to prevent abuse, corruption or totally heretical teaching by the pastor.

many of the denominations are broad enough to encompass a diverse set of beliefs. for example there are both Calvinists and Arminians in the Anglican, Baptist and Campbellite traditions who worship alongside each other.","While people can get caught up more on semantics, I'd say you best bet is to be catholic. We're the oldest Christian church and the church founded by Christ. Delve into the history of the Christian Church and attend some RCIA classes and you'll realize why I say it's best to be Catholic.",,,,,,

&gt; Paul Djupe, who is a political scientist at Denison University, did a recent study looking at the overlap between QAnon and evangelicals. **He found that more than half of white evangelicals agree with the basic beliefs of QAnon.** [my bold]  It has made deep inroads. But that's really not that surprising. When you look at the structure of QAnon, it is essentially a loose collection of pseudo-Christian ideas that have been floating around evangelical Christianity for decades. If we go back to the ""Left Behind"" novels from the 2000s, the building blocks of QAnon are right there.

...

&gt; A proclivity to be the ""victim"" runs deep in terms of theology here as well. This is particularly true in white evangelical circles. Both Republicans and white evangelicals believe that they face more discrimination than other groups such as African Americans and gays and lesbians. That trend has been documented in the polling data and other research for several years. That sense of being under siege has become even stronger during the Trump years. It was certainly there before that, but it's become even stronger.

...

&gt; Again, it is white evangelicals who really stand out as a group, with more than 70% of them saying religious liberty is being threatened. No other religious group in the United States comes anywhere near that. It really is just this one very loud minority group of white evangelicals. Part of the explanation lies in the fact that if you go back to 2008, they were 21% of the population. Today they're only 15% of the population. As white evangelicals have started shrinking as a group, they are getting louder and more desperate.

...

Jesus said his yoke is not burdensome so so do what you’re comfortable with.

And of course pray to God. You can never pray too much and in my experience it helps a lot. I fell away from God for several years but in the last few months by reading and prayer and asking for help from the Holy Spirit I feel closer to both God and Jesus than I ever did before.

However, I believe people can still receive supernatural communication from God, possibly with predictions but more often encouraging words and insight, used to edify.

1 Corinthians 14:3-5

&gt;On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation. The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church. Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.

I generally like John Piper's definition, quoted below. The ""third category"" he mentions is called so because he defines modern prophecy as somewhere between the infallible directly inspired Scripture and the completely uninspired false teachings of false prophets. This definition is taken from the article [""The New Testament Gift of Prophecy,""](https://www.desiringgod.org/articles/the-new-testament-gift-of-prophecy) which contains Scripture citations and some exposition.

&gt;Prophecy in this “third category” (the New Testament gift of prophecy) is a regulated message or report in human words usually made to the gathered believers based on a spontaneous, personal revelation from the Holy Spirit for the purpose of edification, encouragement, consolation, conviction or guidance but not necessarily free from a mixture of human error, and thus needing assessment on the basis of the apostolic (Biblical) teaching and mature spiritual wisdom.

So, therefore, I think most or all God-following and Scripture-teaching pastors and teachers also often or usually prophecy. However, many have taken that title and are not teaching in line with Scripture or are fore-telling false prophecies. These people would not be authentic prophets, because they are not building up the church in line with Scripture toward God.","The time of the prophets is over. God now speaks to us directly only through Scripture. When prophesy is mentioned in the NT it is often used in a context where it is synonymous with simply preaching the word of God. There is and will never be another prophet like that in the OT providing us with new doctrine not found in Scripture.

Consider Heb 1:1-2 (ESV)

&gt; 1Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, 2but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.

Consider 2 Peter 1:16

&gt; 16For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. 17For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,” 18we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain. 19And we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts, 20knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone’s own interpretation. 21For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.

These words were written by Peter shortly before his death. What was Peter saying here? We are not to rely upon new prophetic words, but on the sure and certain Word of God.

The Holy Spirit remains with us works to keep us in The Faith by pointing us to and only speaking of Christ. What does the Holy Spirit speak of Christ? Only that which is revealed to us in scripture so that we know it is of God.

And, let us never forget that a true prophet of God can never be wrong.

Consider:

&gt;Isaiah 8:20

&gt;Jeremiah 23:21

&gt;Hebrews 1:1-2

&gt;2 Timothy 3:16

And consider:

&gt; Love never fails. But whether there are prophecies, they will fail; whether there are tongues, they will cease; whether there is knowledge, it will vanish away. 1 Corinthians 13:8

An excerpt from a good article from First Things:

http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2014/02/standing-with-martin-luther-1

“God does not save those who are only imaginary sinners,” Luther writes. “Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong [ie, sin boldly], but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world.” It is to Christ, not ourselves, that we look for salvation, Luther is saying. He is calling us to be honest about our sin—to recognize its severity—so that we more fully understand our need for Christ. “We will commit sins while we are here,” Luther continues, “for this life is not a place where justice resides. We, however, says Peter (2 Peter 3:13) are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth where justice will reign. It suffices that through God’s glory we have recognized the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world.”",i guess it depends on your own personal conviction,a284fd54-e605-11e4-8d12-22000b3d0a68,,,,,

-----

Q:  How does a person know if he or she has sinned against the Holy Spirit? Could a person commit this sin and not know about it? Is concern about this sin evidence that one has not committed it?

A:  Presumably you are referring to the warning of Jesus against the sin against the Holy Spirit in Matthew 12:31-37 (paralleled in Mark 3:28-30; Luke 12:12). This warning follows the Pharisees’ accusation that Jesus was in collusion with Satan upon hearing of Jesus’ healing of the dumb demoniac (Matt. 12:22-30; cf. parallels in Mark and Luke). In all three Gospel accounts the term “blaspheme” is used to describe this sin against the Holy Spirit. It should be noted that Jesus does not say that the Pharisees had actually themselves committed this sin, but that they were in danger of doing so.

The sin against the Holy Spirit is the conscious, persistent, stubborn, unyielding refusal of someone who was at one time a believer to acknowledge his or her sin, be sorry for it, and desire God's forgiveness in Christ. It is impossible, therefore, for a confessing Christian to fall into this state unknowingly or unwillingly, and any confessing Christian who is sincerely concerned about the possibility of having committed this ""sin"" clearly has not committed it, because one of the necessary signs of being in this state of non-repentance and unbelief is having no real concern or remorse about being in this condition.

I’ll tell you this Christ didn’t tell people to join a denomination/cult he told people to repent and stop sinning and get others to do the same.
What’s is sin?
1 John 3:4 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin is the transgression of the law. The laws we have to keep are the 10 commandments. We have to keep the Sabbath day holy, no physical labor, earning or spending money, cooking, exercising, walking far, driving, using machines, watching worldly entertainment, TV. The dietary laws in Leviticus, chapter 11. We’re not supposed to eat pork, shrimp, crab, lobster or shellfish. We can’t smoke cigarettes and marijuana and use drugs and drink alcohol, and no fornication, pornography or masturbation.       
Christ said the way to Heaven is keeping the commandments and getting others to the same

Matthew 5:19 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven. 
Least means you’ll be called least by those that are actually in Heaven.
20 For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you will by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.
Christ said right here unless you keep the commandments better than the Pharisees you have no chance at Heaven.
Revelation 22:14 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city. 
Those entering Heaven are the ones who kept the commandments.",Even the Catholic Church doesnt teach that.,,,,,,

Adding to u/ViridianLens excellent answer: The Haftorah (i.e. readings from The Prophets) portions read in the synagogues were chosen in such a way that they're thematically linked to the corresponding Torah portions. Isaiah 53 isn't the only chapter that they don't read.

Also, I spent a fair bit of time learning about Judaism and seriously considered converting at one point. Coupla things to note here:

* While there are a lot of religious Jews in Israel, there's also a lot of secular Jews who have no interest in the scriptures. 
* Religious/scriptural education is actually pretty important (and always has been), especially among the more religious Jews so the idea that ""Jews don't read their Bibles"" is both ignorant and offensive. Not saying you're saying this but it's a common idea in Christian circles and really needs to be addressed. 
* Given the amount of harassment that they tend to attract from Christians, plenty of them just want to be left alone. Quite often the easiest way to be left alone is by shutting down a potentially proselytising conversation before it even starts.

574,,Christianity,"Long story short. My mother divorced in 2009, lived off spousal maintenance without working up until 2020 when she ran out of money. She's now in living in debt with her son and daughter. Her hopes and dreams are to be married to prince charming, living in her dream home. She has no friends, does not spend time with her family, does not work, she only goes out to get groceries or shop for things. She does not go to church either (possibly because of social anxiety).

&amp;#x200B;

I myself am a non-believer, but I somewhat understand what it means to be a believer in God, Jesus Christ, The Holy Spirit. From my understanding God gives believers strength to accomplish what they want in life, and to trust in his will means to not get caught up in your own selfish desires and be ok with how things are, because that is what his will is.

&amp;#x200B;

However when I explain this to my mom, she takes things out of the bible and makes them fit her own narrative that works for her only. For example she will say I don't need to go out and meet men because God will find my husband for me. Or I don't need to go out and find a job to support myself because God will do that for me. She believes God will do everything for her, even if she takes literally no actions on her own behalf. She believes he is in control of her entire life.

&amp;#x200B;

I've told her she should at least go see a counselor, go to church, talk to a pastor, go to bible study, just something where she is communicating with other fellow Christians to help guide her in the direction she wants to go. I'm worried if she continues to believe in what she does that she will never find work, never get married, and go further into debt and live the rest of her life with my sister, unhappy and regretful she never took action and went after her hopes and dreams, and a further decline of her mental health. She's 63 and highly dependent on others to take care of her financially, she was a homemaker her entire life and never worked. I'm worried she is creating her own personal interpretation of Christianity to relieve her own pain and suffering.

There once was a man who lived in a two story house.  The house was near a river and unfortunately the river began to flood. 

As the river rose, warnings were given via radio, TV and shortwave. Large jeeps drove through the area to evacuate people.  As a jeep drove by the man's house, he was told:

""You are in danger.  Your life is at stake.  You must evacuate.  Get in the Jeep.  Let us help you evacuate.""
""No,"" the man replied from his doorstep.  ""I have faith.  I will be ok.  The flood won't get me.  God will take care of me.""

The water continued to rise.

Soon the man was on the second floor.  A boat was going through the area and arrived at the man's house. Rescuers made every effort to convince the man to take action so that his life would be saved.

""You are in danger.  Your life is at stake.  You will drown in the flood.""

""No worries,"" says the man.  ""I have faith.  Everything is ok.  Even though the flood is rising, I will be fine.  God will take care of me.""

The flood continued to rise.

The man went to the roof to avoid the rising water.  A helicopter pilot sees him on top of the roof and hovers above the man.  Using a megaphone, the pilot tries to convince the man to grab the rope ladder which was dangling above his head.

""You are in danger.  The flood is still rising.  You will drown if you do not grab the rope ladder.  Let us help you.""

""No worries.""  says the man.  ""I will be fine.  Yes, the flood is higher but I have faith.  God will take care of me.""

The flood rises.  The man drowns.

At the pearly gates, the man says to God:  ""I had faith.  You let me die.""

To which God replies: ""I sent you a jeep, a boat and a helicopter.  What more could I have done for you?""","I would recommend  praying  and sharing bible verses with her daily and do not stop. Nothing like the word of God and prayer to bring healing and clarity.

“And when you are praying, do not use meaningless repetition as the Gentiles do, for they suppose that they will be heard for their many words. So do not be like them; for your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. “Pray, then, in this way:
‘Our Father who is in heaven,
Hallowed be Your name. ‘Your kingdom come.
Your will be done,
On earth as it is in heaven. ‘Give us this day our daily bread. ‘And forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. ‘And do not lead us into temptation, but deliver us from evil. [For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.’] Matthew 6:7-13 


""and let us consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds, not forsaking our own assembling together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more as you see the day drawing near."" Hebrews 10:24-25

Brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; each one looking to yourself, so that you too will not be tempted. Bear one another’s burdens, and thereby fulfill the law of Christ."" Galatians 6:1-2

We urge you, brethren, admonish the unruly, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with everyone. See that no one repays another with evil for evil, but always seek after that which is good for one another and for all people. 1 Thessalonians 5:14-15

Two are better than one because they have a good return for their labor. For if either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion. But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up. Furthermore, if two lie down together they keep warm, but how can one be warm alone? And if one can overpower him who is alone, two can resist him. A cord of three strands is not quickly torn apart. Ecclesiates 4:9-12


What use is it, my brethren, if someone says he has faith but he has no works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is without clothing and in need of daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and be filled,” and yet you do not give them what is necessary for their body, what use is that? Even so faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself. But someone may well say, “You have faith and I have works; show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.” You believe that God is one. You do well; the demons also believe, and shudder. But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? You see that faith was working with his works, and as a result of the works, faith was perfected; and the Scripture was fulfilled which says, “And Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as righteousness,” and he was called the friend of God. You see that a man is justified by works and not by faith alone. In the same way, was not Rahab the harlot also justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way? For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so also faith without works is dead."" James 2:14-24",God helps those who help themselves.,b777118e-fd62-11e3-add3-12313d187c89,,,,,

God doesn't take your promise to seriously. And neither do you.

That's not in the business of punishing anybody right now.

Ask for forgiveness. And move on.","A few things I would hope that you keep in mind are the following:

""Seven times a righteous man falls and yet he will arise,"" Proverbs 24:16.

""If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us of our sins, and cleanse us from all unrighteousness,"" 1 John 1:9.

""You have not failed until you stop trying,"" Dieter Uchtdorf.

You did not develop this addictive behavior overnight so do not be surprised that it takes time to overcome it.

God is not so much interested in how much we stumble as He is in how many times we get back up and try again.  That we keep trying.  That we are doing our best to be obedient to His will.  Because it is in this process of falling down and getting back up and trying once again that God is able to transform us into the person we want to be.

Failure is not necessarily a bad thing.  It forces us to rely on God (the Apostle Paul even makes mention of this in his own struggles (see 2 Corinthians 12:7-10).

God's grace is without limit.  You can repent, you can try again, and you can continue to do so for as long as you keep trying to be obedient.

We all sin, we all have things that we  struggle with.  God knows that.  But, if we keep trying, if we pick ourselves up after each stumble, we will be amazed, when we look back six months or a year from now, just how much the Lord has changed us in the intervening time.",Do you make a lot of promises to god?,,,,,,

So I have to ask why? Why did the Romans fail even with use of their mighty armies as the OP pointed out while Church missionaries and priests eventually converted entire regions and barbarian peoples Rome could never subjugate like the Picts of Scotland even with military force (often suffering immense defeats when they entered regions like Northern Netherlands)? Yet the Catholic Church was not only able to convert these various regions and barbaric tribes through peaceful means yet also  make even the most backwards and warlike of them like the Germanics of Northern Germany submissive to the Church and adopt order and civilization! How did the Church do it despite advocating a religion that condemned violence esp war and advocated order and stable civilization where as mighty armies of the most powerful civilization to have ever existed in Europe have failed so miserably?

It just doesn't make sense that the Germanics north of the Rhine who did human sacrifices and killed and killed each other for fun would eventually find a religion where a God sacrifices himself for mankind appealing to convert to! The Picts committed preying of the weak because much of their culture vouched the rule of the strong and violence as the prime laws-yet all of Scotland would convert through peaceful missionaries to Christianity which is a religion that ruled for the rich and strong to aid the poor in poverty.

The Irish clans practised nature worshipping but some how Catholic priests convinced them that it is better to live in villages and have a strong organized government than to live as random settlements in the woods and other uncultivated wilderness.

Its simple to miraculous that the Catholic Church didn't have to send knights to convert Northern Germany but did this with a couple of martyred saints! And that  the Picts could be convinced by hermits wandering around to start sending charity to the poor and convert to a religion advocating responsibility to watch over the weak and needy! And for people who lived in the wild for centuries in Ireland to throw away their old Gods and follow a Church that encourages a more urban livelihood!

All without needing to send massive armies! The Romans tried to civilize these warlike savages through conquest and subjugation but they failed (often facing mass slaughter of their military forces sent to these barbarian areas they can never actually colonize). But the Church did it through peaceful means with just a couple of preachers voluntarily going across Europe!

577,,Christianity,"Hey brothers and sisters in Christ,

So I was kinda obsessed with Harry Potter last year and ventured to the Gen Z side of tiktok which talks about various spiritual things like “shifting to Hogwarts”, astral projection, manifestation etc. The community would use angel numbers (111,333,444) as a way to manifest things they want to happen, and angel numbers are generally seen as a good sign (if you see them often, it means you’re gonna shift tonight). I’m aware not everyone here can grasp the concept of “shifting” but apparently it’s some astral travel shit that allows u to travel to your desired reality (ie. Hogwarts).

2.) We do not (and cannot) understand. Not only do we not care about God &amp; His Word, but we cannot understand it. It is the Spirit of God that gives understanding of the scriptures. Unsaved people see the preaching of the cross as foolishness, and the Christian walk as the same (v.11).

3.) We do not seek after God. There is nothing in our flesh that desires to seek after the God of the Bible. If we seek after any god, it will be one that pleases our flesh (which is why the world is full of gods and religions). If we are saved, it is because God sought us out, not vice-versa (v.11)

4.) We are all gone out of the way. A life lived in the flesh is a life lived outside of God's will. Unsaved people do not care about God's will for their lives (because God's will is found in His Word). They are as sheep gone astray that find themselves in ruts, pits, brambles, etc. (v.12).

5.) We are unprofitable. There is nothing that we add to God. Even more so, when mankind fell into sin, we became more unprofitable. Unsaved people do not reflect Christ, but their father, the Devil. They do not follow Christ, but the world, flesh, and the Devil. They do not worship God, but the world, flesh, and Devil. There is no profit to this for God or Man, and only leads to destruction (v.12).

6.) We do not do good. What is good? It is that which God defines as such, not mankind. Unsaved people only care about themselves. They only care about feeling good, looking good, and seeking pleasure. Unsaved people only bear the fruit of the flesh, not the Spirit. None of this is good, according to God (v.12).

7.) We do not speak edifying things. Unsaved people only say destructive things. They do not provoke individuals unto good works and righteousness. They do not criticize unto godliness. Unsaved people only want to look good, so they tear others down through wicked speech (v.13-17).

8.) We do not fear God. Fearing God means to respect and honor Him. It can mean to be afraid of His judgment, but is not speaking of being terrified of Him. Unsaved people have no regard for God. They curse Him and have no fear of His judgment. They act as undisciplined children that abuse their parents: ungrateful and disobedient (v.18-22).

Now, this is the condition of mankind as a whole. If you are saved by grace, through faith, this was your condition too. The only thing that made the difference was redemption through faith in Jesus Christ (read Rom 3:23-31). After being saved, our lives are completely changed:

1.) We are made to be righteous. This is justification. Do we still have a sin nature right now? Yes. Are we holy in the sight of God though? Yes. Can we fully understand this? No. At least, not right now.

2.) We are given understanding of the Word through the Spirit. Only the Spirit teaches us the correct interpretation of Scripture. He is given to us upon salvation. Are you thankful for God's Word &amp; the help of His Spirit? These are two great aspects of His grace.

3.) We seek after God. What gives us the desire to follow after Christ &amp; study to apply His Word? God's Spirit. I John states so. Our flesh has no desire for God, so God changes these desires, upon salvation.

4.) We can do God's will. In our flesh, we have no capacity or desire to obey the scriptures, but God changes all of that, upon salvation. God's will and Word never conflict. Ever.

5.) We are still unprofitable. We will never add anything to God. But, at least we can be with Him and be pleasing to Him. Christ states that we will cry out that we are just unprofitable servants, and we will. He does not need us, but chooses to delight in us! He does not have to use us, but chooses to!

6.) We have the desire and capacity to do good. Again, what is good? The world thinks that ""good"" amounts to comfortable, pleasurable, wealthy, etc. God defines ""good"" as whatever makes us to be more like Christ (see Rom 8:28-29). If we do good, then we are doing that which lines up with God's Word, not whatever comes to mind.

7.) We have the desire and capacity to speak properly. This was commanded to the churches many times, in Scripture. Unsaved people have filthy, destructive mouths. God's children are to truly edify one another: provoking one another to righteousness and good works. God's children are to love one another, this means to point one another to Christ. This requires some criticism, at times, and our world/flesh hates to be corrected. But loving language does so anyway, as it wants God's best for one another.

8.) We fear God. We respect Him and do not want to hurt Him. He is our Father, and we honor Him. He is our Shepherd, and we follow Him. He is our Commander, and we obey Him. See how it works? The world is backwards and abusive, but God's children are to be loving and submissive to our Father in Heaven.

This is because before I focus on that part in my life. I promised myself to quick smoking and work out more. Eat healthy, avoid masturbation and pornography. Just general self-care.
So far I've quit smoking weed (not nicotine just yet, although it's harder than I thought), I've been using a rowing machine once a day (i do plan on getting my stamina back once I'm done smoking), and even doing things like journaling every few days. Even avoiding compulsive lying.

God created weed, God gave you a penis, God gave you a heart that feels emotions, and God isn't angry when you play video games, and you know what, God isn't angry at all, he is a Spirit of Love, he doesn't go from being mad and upset 1 minute and then happy and joyful the next, he is always the same, always full of love and joy and peace and happiness, he is a perfect being and if you think you can ruin his mood by doing these silly things, then you believe in some weird man-made version of God and you should probably try to think outside this religious box.

God created us so that he would have someone other than his Son Jesus to love, we are here to be loved by God, not to worship God, not to become perfect and holy, not to live some boring life, but to be loved by God and Jesus, that is what God cares about the most, this and that you believe in Jesus his Son so that you can be born-again as his child.

Does God want you to be holy? Yes of course, God is holy and this is the best way for us to live. Does God want you to smoke weed if it makes you do bad things right after? Nope, not if it is hurting your life in some way, does God want you to spend 6 hours a day playing video games?

But seriously though, stop watching porn at least, that stuff is bad for your mind, body and spirit, but if you do trip up and do it sometimes, remember that God's love for you doesn't change, and he doesn't stop liking you either, he is happy to spend time with you while you are playing video games and smoking weed, I am not saying that he approves of these things, just saying he is much cooler and more chill then most people think, remember Jesus turned water into wine for a wedding celebration, and if you do the math, he made around 160 gallons of wine, meanwhile people say that drinking wine is a bad sin that God forbids... maybe we shouldn't lock God up in a religious box and try to get to know him outside of what religion teaches.",You feel that the path to God must be full of difficulties but it need not.,"SAMEEEEEEEE it sucks so bad. but God sees us trying at least, that's a start. yeah consistency will be hard but its just one step at a time buddy. be proud of ur progress",a284fd54-e605-11e4-8d12-22000b3d0a68,,,,,

20 And God spoke all these words, saying,

2 “I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.

3 “You shall have no other gods before[a] me.

4 “You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing steadfast love to thousands[b] of those who love me and keep my commandments.

7 “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.

8 “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. 11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.

12 “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.

13 “You shall not murder.[c]

14 “You shall not commit adultery.

15 “You shall not steal.

16 “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.

17 “You shall not covet your neighbor's house; you shall not covet your neighbor's wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's.”

18 Now when all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking, the people were afraid[d] and trembled, and they stood far off 19 and said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, lest we die.” 20 Moses said to the people, “Do not fear, for God has come to test you, that the fear of him may be before you, that you may not sin.” 21 The people stood far off, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.

Laws About Altars
22 And the Lord said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the people of Israel: ‘You have seen for yourselves that I have talked with you from heaven. 23 You shall not make gods of silver to be with me, nor shall you make for yourselves gods of gold. 24 An altar of earth you shall make for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and bless you. 25 If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stones, for if you wield your tool on it you profane it. 26 And you shall not go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness be not exposed on it.’

One of my favorite commandments is you shall not bear false witness. Has your pastor lied to you about the Catholic Church changing the 10 Commandments?

&lt;p&gt;4 “You shall not make for yourself a carved image, or any likeness of anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth. 5 You shall not bow down to them or serve them, for I the Lord your God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me, 6 but showing steadfast love to thousands[b] of those who love me and keep my commandments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;7 “You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;8 “Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. 11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;12 “Honor your father and your mother, that your days may be long in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;13 “You shall not murder.[c]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;14 “You shall not commit adultery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;15 “You shall not steal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;16 “You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;17 “You shall not covet your neighbor&amp;#39;s house; you shall not covet your neighbor&amp;#39;s wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor&amp;#39;s.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;18 Now when all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking, the people were afraid[d] and trembled, and they stood far off 19 and said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, lest we die.” 20 Moses said to the people, “Do not fear, for God has come to test you, that the fear of him may be before you, that you may not sin.” 21 The people stood far off, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Laws About Altars
22 And the Lord said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the people of Israel: ‘You have seen for yourselves that I have talked with you from heaven. 23 You shall not make gods of silver to be with me, nor shall you make for yourselves gods of gold. 24 An altar of earth you shall make for me and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I cause my name to be remembered I will come to you and bless you. 25 If you make me an altar of stone, you shall not build it of hewn stones, for if you wield your tool on it you profane it. 26 And you shall not go up by steps to my altar, that your nakedness be not exposed on it.’&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite commandments is you shall not bear false witness. Has your pastor lied to you about the Catholic Church changing the 10 Commandments? Does a pastor who makes blatant lies about the Holy Bible deserve to be your pastor? You deserve a better pastor one that will not lie to you especially about scripture.&lt;/p&gt;

I was healed by God from the addiction of pornography and masturbation almost a year ago today. I knew that dwelling in that sin was bad, but I didn't know how to get over it. The pastor during one of the services was calling for a time of healing and that God would provide healing to those who earnestly ask for it. Initially, I didn't notice any change, but then the pastor mentioned that some of us weren't healed. That was obviously me and it wasn't until I truly repented to God that I was actually healed!

Sure, I had my struggles and temptations even after that, but I knew that the Bible says:

""We demolish arguments and every pretension that sets itself up against the knowledge of God, and we take captive every thought to make it obedient to Christ."" - 2 Corinthians 10:5 | NIV

I had to take everyone of my temptations and submit them to God every time. Just give it all to God because there is going to be the temptation, but you can submit any temptation or thought to God the moment before you submit to that temptation.",a284fd54-e605-11e4-8d12-22000b3d0a68,,,,,

We are made of matter just as science teaches. Science is good, but when it has no solutions, then it's nothing more than crap. There's more to life than just the physical matter that makes us. We have a soul and a conscience. These two cast out all doubts about God's existence in me. 

Jesus is that solution. In Him, we have eternal life, life beyond physical matter.

I would say over 95% of humans were spiritual and believed in some kind of invisible God, closer to 99%

Now ask yourself, how many animals worship a God? How many dogs and cats or monkies are out there praying to an invisible being they have never seen before? 0 none of them do this, they are just creatures, while we are divine beings.

We are special, not just some organic matter, but we have an invisible spirit that was given to us by God, that is why people say we were made in the image of God.

The cool thing is that with modern technology we can measure this, and we have found that right in the center of your body where your heart is, there is a huge powerful charge of electromagnetic energy that is being produced that is 5,000 times stronger than anywhere else in your body.

&gt; This exact line of reasoning appears in the works of Isaac of Nineveh, a seventh-century Syrian bishop and theologian celebrated as a saint in multiple Christian communions, including the Chaldean Catholic Church. In his Ascetical Homilies, Isaac wrote the following: “It is not the way of the compassionate Maker to create rational beings in order to deliver them over mercilessly to unending affliction in punishment for things of which He knew even before they were fashioned, aware how they would turn out when He created them—and whom nonetheless He created.”

&gt; Trusting that the divine grace revealed in Christ would lead to the eventual reconciliation of all creatures with God, Isaac discerned the troubling implications of believing that God could create eternal souls with the possibility that they might be lost to an eternity of suffering. No compassionate maker—no father, as Jesus instructs us to call our God—could countenance such a fate for his children. Indeed, as the Eastern Orthodox theologian David Bentley Hart argues in his recent book, That All Shall Be Saved, it would be better for no earthly parents to reproduce if eternal perdition for our children is a genuine possibility. It becomes difficult to be consistently pro-life when the future of that life appears to be not just temporary but rather permanent and irremediable suffering.

&gt; The fundamental question of secular antinatalist thought is at its core a religious one: Is our life, in the final analysis, truly a gift? [...]

&gt; For those who lack this faith, it is a natural response to wish to eradicate suffering by eradicating life itself. Religious faith provides an antidote against such despairing measures. As “Evangelium Vitae” puts it, a religious outlook provides a “positive understanding of the mystery of suffering” and so frees us from the need to assert control over all suffering and gravely injure human dignity in the process. But this positive understanding of suffering sits in tension with the possibility of eternal loss, as St. Isaac of Nineveh reminds us. If any soul’s final fate does in fact prove to be permanent separation from God, antinatalist logic suddenly becomes very cogent.

&gt; Like all doctrines, Catholic teachings on hell and on the purpose of punishment have seen significant development over the centuries, most especially in the Second Vatican Council, Pope Benedict XVI’s “Spe Salvi” and Pope Francis’ recent proclamation that the death penalty is inadmissible. It remains to be seen whether these changes will lead, in time, to a more confident affirmation that God created all his children with the destiny of eternal redemption. But in the meantime, antinatalist philosophy issues a challenge to Catholics [and protestants] and their pro-life commitment: Can the truth of the intrinsic dignity of human life be coherently reconciled with the prospect of unending suffering?","Interesting. Shouldn't the pro life movement me more concerned about life that exists?

I'm not gonna have biological kids. I will adopt instead. There are too many unloved kids in the world. 

There's an old proverb that says you are responsible for the life you create. Does the pro life ideology stop at childbirth or does it also consider living conditions? 

If life is a gift by God, then who are you to dictate who God gives that gift to?",,,,,https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2021/01/28/what-is-antinatalism-suffering-hell-catholic-theology-239846,

Another mentioned basically not taking it as seriously as a religion (it being something “edgelords” say they believe). I think you’re dealing with both. 

It’s easier to accept a monotheist from another religion because at least that fits part of their worldview. But a pagan? They’ve read stories about early Jews and Christians teaching against paganism, so there may be some emotional connection to that, or sense of responsibility. It’s less common, so it may surprise them because they only associate it with ancient history. For many Christians, there’s a belief that pagan gods are all demons so you’re worshipping evil without knowing it. So they take that part very seriously, while simultaneously probably thinking it wasn’t a deep conviction for you, and

Simultaneously, it’s hard to accept people who find a faith outside of their culture, and they may write you off as playing dress-up with spiritual beliefs. Theyll have a stronger reaction to say a white kid becoming Buddhist and a black man being Muslim, than if it seemed to fit their idea of the person’s heritage. As much as faith is a choice, the world over people are confused by those who chose their own, versus just sticking to their family’s. So you think it’s a phase, or a way to rebel, or a confused person you should set right.

People are right about it partly being just personality of who has to be a jerk about it, too. But there’s more at play than that, and I didn’t want to pretend otherwise. I’m sorry you’ve had to deal with it enough times to notice a pattern. Hopefully other people can revise other insights or heck correct some of my own.","As you say, some Christians are nice and respectful and others aren't. In the same way, some atheists are nice and respectful while others aren't.

This isn't to excuse their actions by any means — it is God's command to us to be loving towards our neighbor and show grace as He has shown us grace — but it is to explain why there might be some like that, because some people are just like that. Being a part of something larger than themselves gives them some sort of vindication to assert themselves over others.

Off topic, but I'm genuinely curious: What draws you to Norse Paganism (I've heard it called Ásatrú if that's more correct)?

When Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, saw this, he left the assembly, took a spear in his hand and followed the Israelite into the tent. He drove the spear into both of them, right through the Israelite man and into the woman's stomach. Then the plague against the Israelites was stopped; ... The Lord said to Moses, ""Phinehas son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, the priest, has turned my anger away from the Israelites. Since he was as zealous for my honor among them as I am, I did not put an end to them in my zeal. Therefore I tell him I am making my covenant of peace with him.

This means we are called to Christ, but need not be overly concerned with enjoying what the world has to offer unless or until it would draw us away from Christ. We put our hope and faith in Christ in His promise to create and strengthen our faith through His Word and sacraments.

An excerpt from a good article from First Things:

http://www.firstthings.com/blogs/firstthoughts/2014/02/standing-with-martin-luther-1

“God does not save those who are only imaginary sinners,” Luther writes. “Be a sinner, and let your sins be strong [ie, sin boldly], but let your trust in Christ be stronger, and rejoice in Christ who is the victor over sin, death, and the world.” It is to Christ, not ourselves, that we look for salvation, Luther is saying. He is calling us to be honest about our sin—to recognize its severity—so that we more fully understand our need for Christ. “We will commit sins while we are here,” Luther continues, “for this life is not a place where justice resides. We, however, says Peter (2 Peter 3:13) are looking forward to a new heaven and a new earth where justice will reign. It suffices that through God’s glory we have recognized the Lamb who takes away the sin of the world.”",a284fd54-e605-11e4-8d12-22000b3d0a68,,,,,
604,,Christianity,"Today in Tenesse,  James A Ray confessed to the assassination of Reverend Martin Luther King. He had been arrested two months after King's death, at London Heathrow Airport attempting to fly to Brussels on a false Canadian passport. At the check-in, it was noticed the name on his passport, Sneyd, was on a Royal Canadian Mounted Police watchlist. The UK quickly extradited Ray to Tennessee, where he was charged with King's murder. He confessed to the crime on March 10, his 41st birthday, after pleading guilty he was sentenced to 99 years in prison. Three days later, he recanted his confession and fired his attorney, claiming he had entered a guilty plea in an effort to avoid the death sentence. This has led to a flourishing of conspiracy theories.

The Reverend Martin Luther King is famous for being a civil rights leader, and was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964 ""for his non-violent struggle for civil rights for the Afro-American population.""  He viewed this struggle for justice as an essential part of his ministry as a Baptist minister, In his own words ‘*I was a preacher of the Gospel. This was my first calling and it still remains my greatest commitment. You know, actually all that I do in civil rights I do because I consider it a part of my ministry. I have no other ambitions in life but to achieve excellence in the Christian ministry.’* His grandfather began the family’s long tenure as pastors of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, serving from 1914 to 1931; his father has served from then until the present, and from 1960 until his death Martin Luther King acted as co-pastor. A strong student and outstanding orator, after three years of theological study at Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania he was elected president of a predominantly white senior class. In his third year at Crozer, King became romantically involved with a white woman who worked as a cook in the cafeteria and planned to marry her, but friends advised against it, saying that an interracial marriage would provoke animosity from both blacks and whites. This could potentially damage his chances of ever pastoring a church in the South. King ended the relationship six months later and tearfully told a friend that he could not endure his mother's pain over the marriage. He continued to have lingering feelings toward the woman he left; one friend was quoted as saying, ""He never recovered”, and later on he struggled with his attraction to different women

He completed a doctorate at Boston University whilst attending philosophy classes at Harvard University as an audit student. His dissertation was titled *A Comparison of the Conceptions of God in the Thinking of Paul Tillich and Henry Nelson Wieman* and came to national attention when he lead the Montgomery Bus Boycott against the policy of racial segregation on the public transit system of Montgomery, the Monday after Rosa Parks, an African-American woman, was arrested for her refusal to surrender her seat to a white person. The Campaign was ultimately successful and led to a United States Supreme Court decision that declared the Alabama and Montgomery laws that segregated buses were unconstitutional. Although the backlash against the court victory was quick, brutal, someone fired a shotgun through the front door of Martin Luther King's home, two buses were fired upon by snipers, the City suspended bus services for several weeks on account of the violence. King published a book, his first, *called Stride Toward Freedom: The Montgomery Story*. and later was signing copies of his book in Harlem when he narrowly escaped death after being stabbed. A mentally ill black woman who thought that King was conspiring against her with communists—stabbed him in the chest with a letter opener. His second book called The Measure of A Man, contained his sermons which argued for man's need for God's love and criticized the racial injustices of Western civilization ""What is Man?"" and ""The Dimensions of a Complete Life.""  However, his memory has become immortal because of a 17-minute speech, later known as ""I Have a Dream"" delivered to over 250,000 civil rights supporters from the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.. In the speech's most famous passage – in which he departed from his prepared text, he draws from imagery from the book of Amos in the Old Testament.

Five years later, in 1968, King was planning a national occupation of Washington, D.C., to be called the Poor People's Campaign, when he was shot by Ray at 6:01 p.m. at a motel in Memphis, Tennessee. After emergency chest surgery, King died and his autopsy revealed that though only 39 years old, he ""had the heart of a 60 year old"", which his biographer Richard Branch attributed to the stress of 13 years in the civil rights movement. His death was followed by riots in many U.S. cities a testament to what an iconic figure he had become., but with a complex legacy for historians to unpack.

You'll find the least resistance in the Eastern Orthodox churches and *some* Lutheran congregations (the father of Christian existentialism was a Lutheran). Some UCC congregations are mystic-friendly too.

Catholics *should* be receptive to mysticism given how many famous mystics were in their tradition, but this isn't the case, in my experience. It probably has to do with the hierarchical structure of the church and how effective it is at policing doctrine in its congregations.

614,,Christianity,"I think a really good way to start with trying to understand what the bible says on a topic is to picture the bible somewhat like a jigsaw puzzle. 


Most people will take, lets say, 5 scriptures/puzzle pieces and put them together, then ""draw"" the rest of the picture in with their own words to show you (essentially what they think) the bible reveals.

Some people try say the bible is too ambiguous, allowing anyone to arrange the puzzle pieces any which way to form any image they want, and as such you must have them and their authority tell you what the bible means.

I disagree with both of those views... 

What if you simply just kept getting more and more pieces to the puzzle (more and more scriptures), placing them together, allowing them to form the picture and interpret themselves? When we have all the pieces of a puzzle they only fit together 1 way and are designed to show a certain picture.

Well i attempted to do this on trying to get the full picture of the afterlife. Does God torture people forever in hell? Is YOLO true and this is your only chance to repent of your sins? Are the dead conscious, or sleeping?

I spent atleast 150 hours so far working on this. I would read arguments people make and the scriptures they use, then take those scriptures and place them into a document allowing the scriptures to interpret themselves (to form their own pictures).  This was a lot more work than it sounds.

This is an 80 page PDF file https://app.box.com/s/5gom621jd0mkmv87cnjcci92my57yra0

I don't give any of my own interpretations. The only thing i do provide as outside info is a page from an older english dictionary to give some insight on how a certain word was used. 

Otherwise this is about 78 pages of scriptures (the font is sized big allowing easier reading on mobile devices). The only thing i do is use bolding, color changes, underlining etc to show where scriptures give clues or connections to other scriptures.

So if your curious on what the bible itself says on the topic of the afterlife i am sure you will find this document valuable. I learned a lot from doing this and i think you will be surprised at what some scriptures say.

For instance, did you know that the bible calls the resurrection of the wicked to judgement a ""hope"" for them? In their punishment/judgement will God allow people to repent in that time period?

&gt;-----Acts 24:15 King James Version

That is exactly the wrong way to do it. The Bible isn't one, coherent book. It is a collection of books, some of which are collections of different pieces written by different authors. It records a conversation between lots of people that took place over thousands of years. They often contradict themselves. Or, if you prefer, ideas that appear at one point are often corrected later on. 

The proper way to understand the Bible is to first attend to what each, individual voice or story is saying. And then look to see how it fits into flow of the conversation.","also, if you look at this and notice a missing point brought up in the scriptures please let me know so i can add it.","I read through your PDF.

Our faith comes not from at an act of will on our part, but is a free gift from God which He has promised to create, strengthen, and maintain through His Word and Sacraments.

The reason people didn't turn into meth monsters with terrible skin and no teeth is because it was pharmaceutical grade like Elvis and Johnny Cash had (which is also why their skin and teeth were fine).  When people talk about the ""good old days"" and compare the crime, addiction, and every other scourge associated with drugs today compared to then, it has all happened as a result of making drugs illegal. 

80 years ago there was a movement to ban alcohol in America and it happened.  That ban brought in a lot of crime, including the mafia.  It brought in unregulated alcohol which caused a number of deaths. It brought in the speakeasy, gambling, and a robust underground market that wasn't paying taxes.  

Our national self righteousness brought in a solution that made the problem exponentially worse. It made criminals out of neighbors and encouraged them to rat each other out, while even the president had his own secret stash. We wised up and got rid of it.  Not long after, we made the same mistake by making drugs illegal.  It was a racist move which went after the drug of choice of different communities that weren't white (we got our alcohol back, after all).  And as a result we have the highest per capita prison rate in the entire world.  We're paying $50,000-$70,000 a year to keep people in prison who were just using drugs in the same we white citizens were using alcohol, and then telling people we can't afford new schools, healthcare for everyone, etc.  What it costs to keep people in prison for drug use could go to our schools, health care, etc., but we've been sold fear because it works every time.

Making something illegal doesn't mean it will go away.  We could make sin illegal and everyone (still) reading this knows they would break the law often.  Would we be righteous to all turn ourselves in every time we broke a law?  This isn't the days of Moses when there were just a handful of laws, we have 70,000 pages just for tax law.

Proverbs 10:19
&gt;When words are many, transgression is not lacking","“Everything God made is good and not to be rejected if it can be received with thanksgiving and using faith responsibly.” That is a big “if,” and the case needs to be made that legal, general marijuana use is responsible and helpful for faith. In the beginning, all was good. However, creation is in bondage to corruption. There are *many* plants (and other materials and animals) that will kill us with even a small amount. We should not just ingest any plant because it exists or is natural in some sense and therefore it is “good.”

Food and sleep seem to be a little bit of comparing apples to oranges. We need food and sleep. They can be abused, but we also can’t live (generally) without their proper use. Now, alcohol is a tougher one to think about. However, my understanding of most non-medical marijuana use is that a little bit causes larger affects than a little alcohol, that being responsible and not altering one’s mental state to excess is more difficult with marijuana than alcohol, and that the effects of marijuana have some significant differences from alcohol.

I do think hyperbole like the second speaker starts off with – a hyper-puritanical mindset – is not helpful. There are legitimate discussions to be had about the relative possible dangers and benefits of marijuana use to individuals and society.

Law in general one area that I greatly struggle with. I do very much believe that some things need to be restricted or regulated by government action, and other things do not. Having a non-Church government and laws is not in itself being hyper-puritanical, and I don’t think all of the arguments presented here work well. However, I do not always know where the line of law needs to be drawn; that is something I need to do much more learning and praying about in general, and there is *some* nuance to this particular issue.",,,,,,https://youtu.be/VxZv4gFDHdc,
