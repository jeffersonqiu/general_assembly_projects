Coffee has many proven health benefits and in moderate doses enhances concentration. Buddhist monks traditionally drink tea and the Abott of a nearby Thai Temple makes a mean iced coffee.  

Cigarettes? I don't know, I don't smoke.","The general perspective I think is that they don't lead to heedlessness and so they are ok.

I personally think, though, that to be honest there's a little bit of hypocrisy or inconsistency in the thought.

For example, if someone drinks coffee regularly and then goes without it, they may get irritable and act in a way that is not particularly nice. There seems to be an aspect of heedlessness there.

Same with nicotine, basically.

Furthermore, as you say, something like microdosing psilocybin or LSD is not going to lead to any heedlessness more than drinking coffee would, it would seem. Or, say, taking low dose adderall - I would say that low dose adderall could be compared to coffee, although I would imagine that if someone was like, ""Oh, I don't have ADHD, I just like using adderall to help me meditate"", a lot of people would think that's sort of 'cheating', but those same people wouldn't think that having tea or coffee is cheating. To me, this difference in view between the two seems like basically nothing more than a cultural more thing rather than a real distinction when it comes to the 5th precept.

For me, personally, I think it's worthwhile to consider the heart of the precept, which is pramada/pamada, or 'heedlessness'. This, basically, as I understand it is essentially a state of mind in which one is not committed to and/or not able to perform virtue and avoid non-virtue.

If something leads to heedlessness, in general it would break the 5th precept. If something truly doesn't, and/or if it's truly used as a medicine, then it does not break the 5th precept. More or less.

Some make an additional argument that certain substances cannot lead to heedlessness whereas others can.

For example, LSD or psilocybin at a low dose may not, but taken at a higher dose it may. Hence, it is an intoxicant and should be avoided.

Tea for instance if you drank too much would make you very jittery and uncomfortable but it would not lead to heedlessness per se, and so it is acceptable. 

I think this argument, personally, is somewhat shaky and subjective, but I've heard it made and to a certain extent I can understand the argument. I don't necessarily agree with it, but I understand it to some degree.","The precept, at it's core, is about abstaining from intoxication and embracing mental clarity.

Alcohol, while not necessarily intoxicating in low doses has an exceedingly high potential for abuse... and I suspect the reason it's addressed so frequently in the suttas.

Technically speaking, the precept excludes medicine.... so opiates, medical marijuana or even micro dose lcd/mushrooms don't present issue if prescribed (and used as intended to treat a given ailment).  

It hasn't been my experience that caffeine or nicotine dull the mind.  Their both mild stimulants.

That said, as a caffeine and nicotine addict I find myself at odds with the fifth precept (even though most would find me in compliance).  While neither intoxicate me, missing a ""dose"" certainly leads to a lapse in mental clarity.",,,,,,,,,,

8,,Buddhism,"I'm new and trying to learn more about Buddhism. I've gone through parts of Thich Nhat Hanh's ""The Heart of Buddha's Teachings"" and parts of Gunaratana's ""Mindfulness in Plain English"" as well as parts of the Secular Buddhism podcast.

I can see how you can be mindful during a seated meditation session or when washing dishes or while doing other tasks that don't require active thinking. How does this extend to activities that require deep, careful thinking, especially if this is part of your work?

For example, in the last paragraph of Chapter 14 in ""Mindfulness in Plain English"", the author states ""You can be mindful while solving problems in intensive calculus."" What is the nature of such mindfulness? If your mind is so busy trying to figure out the problem at hand, how can you also be mindful of it?

&lt;p&gt;I can see how you can be mindful during a seated meditation session or when washing dishes or while doing other tasks that don&amp;#39;t require active thinking. How does this extend to activities that require deep, careful thinking, especially if this is part of your work?&lt;/p&gt;

It's stuck with me and I wanted to share it with you. Excerpt below:



*""But active, concerned people don't have time to spend leisurely, walking along paths of green grass and sitting beneath trees. One must prepare projects, consult with the neighbors, try to resolve a million difficulties; there is hard work to do. One must deal with every kind of hardship, every moment keeping one's attention focused on the work, alert, ready to handle the situation ably and intelligently.* 

*You might well ask: Then how are we to practice mindfulness?* 

*My answer is: keep your attention focused on the work, be alert and ready to handle ably and intelligently any situation which may arise -this is mindfulness. There is no reason why mindfulness should be different from focusing all one's attention on one's work, to be alert and to be using one's best judgment. During the moment one is consulting, resolving, and dealing with whatever arises, a calm heart and self- control are necessary if one is to obtain good results. Anyone can see that. If we are not in control of ourselves but instead let our impatience or anger interfere, then our work is no longer of any value. ""*","Good question.

The Buddha teaches: 
&gt; Or his mindfulness is established with the thought, ""Consciousness exists,"" to the extent necessary just for knowledge and mindfulness, and he lives detached, and clings to nothing in the world. Thus, monks, a monk lives contemplating consciousness in consciousness.

I get a lot from two phrases - ‚Äúconsciousness in consciousness‚Äù and ‚Äúclings to nothing in the world‚Äù. I have to admit that thinking can sometimes be quite delicious. I crave a thinking! I also have experienced meta-cognition. I am able to look at myself doing calculus. I belief that is the essence of mindfulness. The point of view of Dharma is that upadana (clinging) leads to bhava (becoming) which leads to dukkha. The Buddha makes this point several times ‚Äî the point of practice is to see that there is nothing *worth* clinging to. This is something that I try to bring into meta-thinking. Is this thought worth finishing? Is this idea important? Am I clinging to my thoughts and ideas? Is this worth it? That might be the starting point for looking at the difference between experiencing a thought and a thought chain. Awareness of thinking makes a difference.","The answer is that basically you can't do both at the same time. Deep analytical work does not allow for [sati-sampajanna](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampaja%C3%B1%C3%B1a) (mindfulness-clear comprehension) to arise. This is why, for example, yogis are discouraged from reading while on intensive retreat.

When you are doing analytical/thought work, do that work fully. That will at least help with mundane concentration.

You can work on developing sati in your formal meditation as well as off the cushion when you standing in line at the pharmacy, or walking the dog, driving to work, etc.",,,,,,,,,,

10,,Buddhism,"""As a consequence of recognizing the third category of suffering, that is 'the pervasive suffering of conditioning', you will begin to develop a deep sense of disenchantment with worldly experience and everything that is by nature suffering. This will engender in you a genuine desire and aspiration to achieve a state of liberation that is totally free from such dissatisfaction and suffering. That type of aspiration is called 'renunciation'. When you are inspired by such a deep and genuine sense of renunciation, and engage in the practices of 'samatha' and 'vipasyana' -- single pointedness of mind and special insight into the nature of phenomena -- you will have embraced what is the essence of the practice of the Fundamental Vehicle.

When you are imbued with this altruistic attitude and then engage in the practice of the six perfections, that comprises the essence of the practice of the Mahayana path.

The practice of the six perfections can be summed up as the practice of method and wisdom.

Wow. So he sounds like a very valid source.

I was, admittedly, skeptical because he looks like an academic and it seems there are a lot of (sorry to say it) white academics who take it upon themselves to spread harmful misinformation about Buddhism. There was a post on this subreddit recently from an American professor ""Expert"" of Buddhism who began by explaining that the first noble truth is ""Life is suffering."" I don't understand why they do this, even a high school student writing a research paper would be capable of figuring out the actual wording/meaning of the four noble truths if they were really trying.

I had never heard of Alan B Wallace before but I'm very happy that his credentials seem good. It's actually unexpected for a science-oriented person as some of the meditation scientists I've read about seem to me to be not actually Buddhist.

I would be interested to know, for example, who was his own teacher, that he is apparently authorised to teach Dzogchen.

The Story of Ananda, the Rich Man

While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (62) of this book, with reference to a miserly rich man, named Ananda.

There was once a very wealthy man named Ananda in Savatthi. Although he possessed eighty crores, he was very reluctant to give anything in charity. To his son, Mulasiri, he used to say, ""Don't think the wealth we have now is very much. Do not give away anything from what you have, for you must make it grow. Otherwise your wealth will dwindle away."" This rich man had five pots of gold buried in his house and he died without revealing their location to his son.

Ananda, the rich man, was reborn in a village of beggars, not far from Savatthi. From the time his mother was pregnant, the income of the beggars decreased; the villagers thought there must be a wicked and unlucky one amongst them. By dividing themselves up into groups and by the process of elimination, they came to the conclusion that the pregnant beggar woman must be the unfortunate one. Thus, she was driven out of the village. When her son was born, the son proved to be extremely ugly and repulsive. If she went out begging by herself, she would get as before, but if she went out with her son she would get nothing. So, when the boy could go out by himself, his mother placed a plate in his hand and left him. As he wandered about in Savatthi, he remembered his old house and his past existence. So he went into the house. When the sons of his son Mulasiri saw him, they were frightened by his ugly looks and began to cry. The servants then beat him and threw him out of the house.

The Buddha who was on his alms-round saw the incident and asked the Venerable Ananda to fetch Mulasiri. When Mulasiri came, the Buddha told him that the young beggar was his own father in his previous existence. But Mulasiri could not believe it. So, the Buddha directed the beggar boy to show where he had buried his five pots of gold. Then only, Mulasiri accepted the truth and from that time he became a devoted lay-disciple of the Buddha.

Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;putta: sons also means both son and daughter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Story of Ananda, the Rich Man&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (62) of this book, with reference to a miserly rich man, named Ananda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was once a very wealthy man named Ananda in Savatthi. Although he possessed eighty crores, he was very reluctant to give anything in charity. To his son, Mulasiri, he used to say, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t think the wealth we have now is very much. Do not give away anything from what you have, for you must make it grow. Otherwise your wealth will dwindle away.&amp;quot; This rich man had five pots of gold buried in his house and he died without revealing their location to his son.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ananda, the rich man, was reborn in a village of beggars, not far from Savatthi. From the time his mother was pregnant, the income of the beggars decreased; the villagers thought there must be a wicked and unlucky one amongst them. By dividing themselves up into groups and by the process of elimination, they came to the conclusion that the pregnant beggar woman must be the unfortunate one. Thus, she was driven out of the village. When her son was born, the son proved to be extremely ugly and repulsive. If she went out begging by herself, she would get as before, but if she went out with her son she would get nothing. So, when the boy could go out by himself, his mother placed a plate in his hand and left him. As he wandered about in Savatthi, he remembered his old house and his past existence. So he went into the house. When the sons of his son Mulasiri saw him, they were frightened by his ugly looks and began to cry. The servants then beat him and threw him out of the house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Buddha who was on his alms-round saw the incident and asked the Venerable Ananda to fetch Mulasiri. When Mulasiri came, the Buddha told him that the young beggar was his own father in his previous existence. But Mulasiri could not believe it. So, the Buddha directed the beggar boy to show where he had buried his five pots of gold. Then only, Mulasiri accepted the truth and from that time he became a devoted lay-disciple of the Buddha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verse 62: &amp;quot;I have sons, I have wealth&amp;quot;; with this (feeling of attachment) the fool is afflicted. Indeed, he himself is not his own, how can sons and wealth be his?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May all sentient beings find the Path leading to The cessation of suffering, Nibbana.

And what is wrong view? 'There is nothing given, nothing offered, nothing sacrificed. There is no fruit or result of good or bad actions. There is no this world, no next world, no mother, no father, no spontaneously reborn beings; no contemplatives or brahmans who, faring rightly &amp; practicing rightly, proclaim this world &amp; the next after having directly known &amp; realized it for themselves.' This is wrong view.

&gt;""And what is right view? Right view, I tell you, is of two sorts: There is right view with effluents, siding with merit, resulting in acquisitions [of becoming]; there is right view that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path.

&gt;""And what is the right view that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path? The discernment, the faculty of discernment, the strength of discernment, analysis of qualities as a factor for awakening, the path factor of right view[1] in one developing the noble path whose mind is noble, whose mind is without effluents, who is fully possessed of the noble path. This is the right view that is noble, without effluents, transcendent, a factor of the path.

With that said, again, you can start where you're at and see.","The basic definition of being a Buddhist is to take refuge in the triple jewel (Buddha, Dhamma, and Sangha). The teachings about rebirth are an integral aspect of the teaching of the Buddha, and cannot be coherently removed. A person who has taken refuge in thr triple jewel at least gives the Dhamma the benefit of the doubt, and places some faith in the triple jewel. A Buddhist would not reject the teachings of Buddha, even if they have doubts or don't understand, but rather take the teachings on as a kind of working hypnosis.","You are free to practice many Buddhist practices and even believe many Buddhist beliefs, without being Buddhist.",,,,,,,,,,
17,,Buddhism,"Namaste Everyone,

I'm a new Religious Studies teacher, and I have a question from a student I would like to ask the Buddhist community as I was curious to know what practising Buddhists really think:

We were studying the five precepts and we focused on the notion of ahimsa, nonviolence, using not eating meat as our example, and one of my students asked if Buddhists would eat lab-grown meat, as it technically does not involve causing pain to a sentient being, as it is grown from the cell of a living animal.

I sat on the fence, saying I agreed to an extent that some would think this potentially fine as you're not killing the animal or causing suffering by taking a cell sample, but others would not as the process of farming the animal whose cell you word be harvesting could potentially be causing suffering as the animal might live in unsatisfactory conditions, or be killed once it was no longer deemed viable. 

I told my student I would ask you guys, as we're really keen to know what your thoughts are. He thought it was very cool I knew a whole community, and I think he was imagining me running off to visit a Buddhist monastery in the mountains this weekend to ask, but alas, Covid...

Theravada monastics follow the triple clean rule of not eating meat they have seen, heard, or suspect was from an animal killed specifically for them. Many laypeople utilize this rule for themselves as well. This means meat available at modern grocery stores or restaurants is largely acceptable within the ethical framework of killing and eating. The common example of a purchase that is contrary to this principle is animals kept alive until preparation, like crab or lobster. 

Here are a couple of relevant suttas:

https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/KN/StNp/StNp2_2.html

https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN55.html

You might have a misunderstanding of what is meant by nonviolence in the Buddhist context, if you were using meat consumption as a way to talk about it. Here is a study guide on the topic based on the Pali suttas https://www.dhammatalks.org/ebook_index.html#Non-violence","As a Buddhist one must not cause suffering to others. That is the principal in deciding whether an action is ""wholesome"" or not. It cannot be reduced to a question of being a vegetarian, non-vegetarian, vegan, etc.


It is not ok to kill another being, or have it killed at your behest, for your own benefit. So lab grown meat is not directly hurting a being, and maybe acceptable.


But it is not always clear about whether our actions are hurting others.
In industrialized world where we don't gather/grow our own food, we cannot always understand the impact of our choice on other beings - even if we choose veg or vegan option for food. The product we use may have come from a forced labour factory, for example. Or its mass production may have contributed to climate change that affects all living beings!. The only reasonable thing to do, IMO, would be to live simply, with least possible impact on the environment.","Is not required to not eat meat. Is really up to the person.

One could say monks are attached to robes, food and monasteries if taken in the wrong light.

Buy only what you need. Don't be wasteful. Don't spend on frivolous things.

A lot of us go through this including myself. Reality is that in many places you cannot survive without it. If I tried living without money here I'd be arrested for vagrancy and begging.

I spent money on my computer. With it I read suttas and work.

I spend money on shelter. In it I meditate and sleep.

I spend money on food. Without it I could not survive.

Use it to help further yourself on the buddhist path if that is your goal.","For me there was a fear I had to fight early on and that's the idea that If I don't have all the money I can possibly get from my job I won't be able to survive. Even though I am able to clothe, feed, and do the things I enjoy there was that unnecessary fear in the back of my mind. This fear caused me to be less generous when I had the capacity to do so, it caused me to go into negative mind states when my peers were successful. So even when I was successful and had everything I needed to be content the unnecessary fear kept me in a bad state of mind. What I did was to practice the paramitas+brahmaviharas/paramis to not only others, but myself. These practice alter the way you process information and will lead to a healthier relationship to money.","Conquer anger

25,,Buddhism,"Since I was a kid, I wake up randomly at night. Sometimes when I wake up, I feel like there's this wind trying to push me out of my body. I don't feel If the wind is cold or hot. All I know is its loud and is pushing me. I'ts not sleep paralysis because I can move but I'm too scared to. At that moment I can't relax knowing that if I will, I will be flown away. 
Like for example, today I had this happen to me again. I was extremely sleepy yet I knew if I let myself sleep, I might be flown away. I tried focussing on noises around me, that helped but as soon as I tried to sleep again, I felt the push again.

I might start with working with this. If it's been happening since you were a kid and hasn't killed you yet, then, evidently there is nothing to be scared of. 

&gt;I was extremely sleepy yet I knew if I let myself sleep, I might be flown away.

How did you know that? How many times have you been actually blown away before? If the answer is, none, then why do you think this? 

&gt;Is this a part of spiritual awakening?

You mean, your fear of a sensation? What do you think, have you read any descriptions of awakening as being a fear of sensation? 

&gt;Am I shifting dimensions? 

no

&gt;Does anyone know what this is? 

Yes. You're experiencing a sensation in your mind that you are reacting to with fear. I don't know if you can get rid of the sensation. But you can work on not reacting to it. Either the sensation, or your fear. You're not going to blow away from a sensation you feel while sleeping.",Hi friend I‚Äôm not sure if a more experienced bodhisatva wants to jump in but it sounds like you should go get an EKG or get to a sleep clinic!

&gt;‚ÄúA fourth herd of deer reasoned thus: ‚ÄòThat first herd of deer, venturing unwarily into the poison-grass sown by the poison-grass sower, ate food‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why that first herd of deer didn‚Äôt escape from the poison-grass sower‚Äôs power &amp; control. The second herd of deer‚Ä¶ their bodies having become extremely gaunt, lost their strength &amp; energy. Having lost their strength &amp; energy, they returned to the poison-grass sown by the poison-grass sower. Venturing unwarily into the poison-grass sown by the poison-grass sower, ate food.‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why that second herd of deer didn‚Äôt escape from the poison-grass sower‚Äôs power &amp; control. The third herd of deer‚Ä¶ took up residence near where poison-grass had been sown by the poison-grass sower and‚Äîhaving taken up residence there‚Äîate food without venturing unwarily into the poison-grass sown by the poison-grass sower.‚Ä¶ But the poison-grass sower &amp; his followers‚Ä¶ had the sown poison-grass surrounded on all sides over a large area with stick snares. They saw the third herd of deer‚Äôs dwelling, where they went to hide. That‚Äôs why that third herd of deer didn‚Äôt escape from the poison-grass sower‚Äôs power &amp; control.
&gt;
&gt;‚Äú‚ÄòWhat if we were to take up residence where the poison-grass sower &amp; his followers can‚Äôt go and‚Äîhaving taken up residence there‚Äîwere to eat food without venturing unwarily into the poison-grass sown by the poison-grass sower? By eating food without venturing unwarily into the poison-grass sown by the poison-grass sower, we won‚Äôt become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, we won‚Äôt become heedless. When we aren‚Äôt heedless, the poison-grass sower won‚Äôt be able to do with us as he likes on account of that poison-grass.‚Äô
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúSo the fourth herd of deer took up residence where the poison-grass sower &amp; his followers couldn‚Äôt go and‚Äîhaving taken up residence there‚Äîate food without venturing unwarily into the poison-grass sown by the poison-grass sower. By eating food without venturing unwarily into the poison-grass sown by the poison-grass sower, they didn‚Äôt become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, they didn‚Äôt become heedless. When they weren‚Äôt heedless, the poison-grass sower wasn‚Äôt able to do with them as he liked on account of that poison-grass.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThe thought occurred to the poison-grass sower &amp; his followers, ‚ÄòHow crafty &amp; powerful is this fourth herd of deer! They must be wizards! How can they eat where the poison-grass has been sown without our knowing their coming or going! What if we were to have the sown poison-grass surrounded on all sides over a large area with stick snares? Perhaps we would see the fourth herd of deer‚Äôs dwelling, where they go to hide.‚Äô So they had the sown poison-grass surrounded on all sides over a large area with stick snares. But the poison-grass sower &amp; his followers didn‚Äôt see the fourth herd of deer‚Äôs dwelling, where they went to hide.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúSo the thought occurred to the poison-grass sower &amp; his followers, ‚ÄòIf we scare off the fourth herd of deer, they, scared off, will scare off others, and in that way all the herds of deer will abandon this sown poison-grass. Why don‚Äôt we show no concern for the fourth herd of deer?‚Äô So the poison-grass sower &amp; his followers showed no concern for the fourth herd of deer. That‚Äôs why that fourth herd of deer escaped from the poison-grass sower‚Äôs power &amp; control.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThis simile, monks, I have given to convey a message. The message is this: The poison-grass stands for the five strings of sensuality. The poison-grass sower stands for MƒÅra, the Evil One. The poison-grass sower‚Äôs followers stand for MƒÅra‚Äôs followers. The herds of deer stand for contemplatives &amp; brahmans.
&gt;
&gt;...
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúA fourth group of contemplatives &amp; brahmans reasoned thus: ‚ÄòThat first group of contemplatives &amp; brahmans, venturing unwarily into the poison-grass &amp; baits of the world sown by MƒÅra, ate food.‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why that first group of contemplatives &amp; brahmans didn‚Äôt escape from MƒÅra‚Äôs power &amp; control.
&gt;
&gt;‚Äú‚ÄòThe second group of contemplatives &amp; brahmans‚Ä¶ entirely avoided that poison-grass food, the baits of the world. Avoiding that dangerous enjoyment, they dwelled having plunged into a wilderness area.‚Ä¶ But in the last month of the hot season, when the grass &amp; water were used up, their bodies became extremely gaunt.‚Ä¶ Having lost their strength &amp; energy, they lost their awareness-release. Having lost their awareness-release, they returned to the poison-grass &amp; baits of the world sown by MƒÅra.‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why that second group of contemplatives &amp; brahmans didn‚Äôt escape from MƒÅra‚Äôs power &amp; control.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThe third group of contemplatives &amp; brahmans‚Ä¶ took up residence near where poison-grass &amp; the baits of the world had been sown by MƒÅra and‚Äîhaving taken up residence there‚Äîate food without venturing unwarily into the poison-grass &amp; the baits of the world sown by MƒÅra.‚Ä¶ But they came to hold views like this: ‚ÄòThe cosmos is eternal.‚Äô ‚Ä¶ ‚ÄòAfter death a TathƒÅgata neither exists nor does not exist.‚Äô That‚Äôs why that third group of contemplatives &amp; brahmans didn‚Äôt escape from MƒÅra‚Äôs power &amp; control.
&gt;
&gt;‚Äú‚ÄòWhat if we were to take up residence where MƒÅra &amp; his followers can‚Äôt go and‚Äîhaving taken up residence there‚Äîwere to eat food without venturing unwarily into the poison-grass &amp; baits of the world sown by MƒÅra? By eating food without venturing unwarily into the poison-grass &amp; baits of the world sown by MƒÅra, we won‚Äôt become intoxicated. Not being intoxicated, we won‚Äôt become heedless. When we aren‚Äôt heedless, MƒÅra won‚Äôt be able to do with us as he likes on account of that poison-grass &amp; the baits of the world.‚Äô
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúSo the fourth group of contemplatives &amp; brahmans took up residence where MƒÅra &amp; his followers couldn‚Äôt go and‚Äîhaving taken up residence there‚Äîate food without venturing unwarily into the poison-grass &amp; baits of the world sown by MƒÅra.

That‚Äôs why that fourth group of contemplatives &amp; brahmans escaped from MƒÅra‚Äôs power &amp; control.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThis fourth group of contemplatives &amp; brahmans, I tell you, is just like the fourth herd of deer.
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúAnd how is there the place where MƒÅra &amp; his followers can‚Äôt go?
&gt;
&gt;‚ÄúThere is the case where a monk, quite secluded from sensuality, secluded from unskillful qualities, enters &amp; remains in the first jhƒÅna: rapture &amp; pleasure born of seclusion, accompanied by directed thought &amp; evaluation. This is said to be a monk who has blinded MƒÅra, who has destroyed the path of MƒÅra‚Äôs eye and has gone where MƒÅra the Evil One can‚Äôt see him.

&gt;‚ÄòThe aristocrat is best of those people

That verse was well sung by BrahmƒÅ Sana·πÖkumƒÅra, not poorly sung; well spoken, not poorly spoken, beneficial, not harmful, and it was approved by me. For I also say this:

&gt;The aristocrat is best of those people

His use of the 'inter-being' model comes from Huayan Buddhism and the Avatamsaka Sutra's usage of the Indra's Net imagery, so it isn't completely unheard of, but it's a particular framing that is meant to sound more positive than 'emptiness.' His original Anglophone audience would've had little to no exposure to Buddhism beforehand, so I think he felt he had to choose his words very wisely, else give a bad first impression.

There's another thing. The ""one"" that Thich Nhat Hanh is probably using here is the one from his name: *nh·∫•t*, which isn't oneness in a singular sense ( *m·ªôt* ), but rather has a connotation of ""gathered together"" or ""disparate parts that have been unified"". So we have different words for these ideas in Vietnamese, where the ""oneness"" of samadhi or phenomena or mind and body is not the same thing as saying they are ""one"" in the sense of being essentially contiguous, but there is only a single word in English to express both ideas.

Like, there is a *huge* difference between saying One Mind (Nh·∫•t T√¢m) and saying One Mind (M·ªôt T√¢m), but that difference is very easily lost in translation because the English term blurs both meanings into one idea.","As u/animuseternal stated, TNH's teachings are directed towards Westerners who have had little to no exposure to Buddhism, and the way in which he describes things and the concepts he goes over, are done in a way to not give such people the wrong impression.

For example, emptiness as the Buddha described/taught it, would give someone who has no basis in the fundamentals of Buddhist teachings a hugely wrong idea about what Buddhism may be. So from time to time, if you continue to follow him, you may hear things that would cause you to raise an eyebrow.","Alan B. Wallace is incredible.

If they were around forever, people would become lazy, thinking, ""oh the Buddha will always be here, I don't need to practice right now, I can just do it later"" and thus will never reach bodhi. It would seem though that if a Buddha were to be requested to stay prior to their decision to display Parinirvana, then that is an indication that He is truly needed for the purpose of one's practice and not out of laziness. This is why one of Samantabhadra's Vows is to request buddhas to stay in the world. If one requests the Buddha to stay after their decision to display Parinirvana, it shows that they're only trying to prolong their own non-practicing and don't actually have an interest in the Buddha staying for their practice, as then they would've requested it a long time ago.

Remember that the Buddhas act according to the needs of us sentient beings. If we needed the Buddha to stay, He would've stayed. But if His staying becomes a hindrance, then He will leave.","I don't know tbh, it was something that struck me as odd when I first read it. It's all detailed in the Mahaparanibbana Sutta:

&gt;53. Then the Venerable Ananda said: ""This, O Lord, I have heard and learned from the Blessed One himself when the Blessed One said to me: 'Whosoever, Ananda, has developed, practiced, employed, strengthened, maintained, scrutinized, and brought to perfection the four constituents of psychic power could, if he so desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it. The Tathagata, Ananda, has done so. Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it.'""  
&gt;  
&gt;54. ""And did you believe it, Ananda?""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Yes, O Lord, I did.""  
&gt;  
&gt;""Then, Ananda, the fault is yours. Herein have you failed, inasmuch as you were unable to grasp the plain suggestion, the significant prompting given by the Tathagata, and you did not then entreat the Tathagata to remain. For if you had done so, Ananda, twice the Tathagata might have declined, but the third time he would have consented. Therefore, Ananda, the fault is yours; herein have you failed.  
&gt;  
&gt;55. ""At Rajagaha, Ananda, when dwelling at Vultures' Peak, I spoke to you, saying: 'Pleasant, Ananda, is Rajagaha; pleasant is Vultures' Peak. Whosoever, Ananda, has developed... Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it.'  
&gt;  
&gt;56. ""So also at the Banyan Grove, at Robbers' Cliff, at the Sattapanni Cave on the Vebhara Mountain, at the Black Rock of Isigili, at the Serpents' Pool in the Cool Forest, at the Tapoda Grove, at the Bamboo Grove in the Squirrels' Feeding-ground, at Jivaka's Mango Grove, and at Small Nook in the Deer Park I spoke to you in the same words, saying: 'Pleasant, Ananda, is Rajagaha, pleasant are these places. Whosoever, Ananda, has developed... Therefore the Tathagata could, if he so desired, remain throughout a world-period or until the end of it.'

&gt;  
&gt;57. ""So also at Vesali, Ananda, at different times the Tathagata has spoken to you, saying: 'Pleasant, Ananda, is Vesali; pleasant are the shrines of Udena, Gotamaka, Sattambaka, Bahuputta, Sarandada, and Capala.

&gt;  
&gt;58. ""Yet, Ananda, have I not taught from the very beginning that with all that is dear and beloved there must be change, separation, and severance? Of that which is born, come into being, is compounded and subject to decay, how can one say: 'May it not come to dissolution!' There can be no such state of things. And of that, Ananda, which the Tathagata has finished with, that which he has relinquished, given up, abandoned, and rejected ‚Äî his will to live on ‚Äî the Tathagata's word has been spoken once for all: 'Before long the Parinibbana of the Tathagata will come about.

Reading the Buddha's words can come off kind of cold as in what numbersev shared below but what I said above is my interpretation.

The Buddha letting go of the fetters would imply he'd be accepting of death. Only if one were to persuade him to remain for their well being essentially would he.

33,,Buddhism,"I think Buddhism is showing me some kind of path, and I'm wondering if I am going in the right direction. Here comes my understanding of it so far.

When ""finding"" yourself, I think the moment you try to limit yourself into something, you are very much not that. Thus I like the Buddhist approach (I believe to have read it somewhere?) of instead of limiting yourself to what you are, do the opposite and do not limit yourself.

How I see the real me as of now: consider all the parts a human is made of, and then discard everything that is in an impermanent state (during this lifetime). What I see remains is the suchness that is always in the same state (at least during this lifetime). I won't put a name on it but I hope it is somewhat clear what I mean? (I guess I am mainly pointing at the 5 aggregates now.)

And I think then that confusion arises from being distracted by feelings, body, perception, etc. (Which sort of, shall I say, ""sit"" on top of the suchness) I have a hard time putting this all into words which I again believe to be from the confusion, so right now I do not see it clearly.

I wonder if my understanding of this on an intellectual level is somewhat in the right direction, and that what I think I need to do now is start practicing more, so that instead of acknowledging it, I can actually start living it.

Another important teaching to go along with the five aggregates is dependent origination and the 12 nidanas (causal links). Feeling is both one of the five aggregates and one of the twelve links of dependent origination. All arisen things are inconstant and empty of a permanent identity or self. Feeling arises due to contact, and in turn feeling leads to craving, craving to the arising of dukkha. So if you find you're experiencing stress or suffering, you can in a way reverse engineer it by investigating the underlying and subtle craving that is there as a result of a feeling (pleasant, unpleasant or neutral). 

If you can see the craving and feeling for what they are: dependently originated, inconstant, empty and not yours, then that Noble Right View will put an end to the suffering. Ignorance, the primordial cause of all stress and suffering has been replaced with Buddha insight and wisdom.","In general I think [this](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/notself2.html) is a decent pointer.

&gt;...""Am I suffering stress because I'm holding onto this particular phenomenon? Is it really me, myself, or mine? If it's stressful but not really me or mine, why hold on?""

Being deficient in certain nutrients can sometimes affect melanin production as well; vitamin B-12 is the most common culprit, with folate, copper, and iron deficiencies being known factors.

The most common reason we go grey is because of genetics: the melanin-producing cells in our hair follicles die and once they're gone, they don't come back.

There's some dispute about whether to change breathing with Anapanasati, as in find a way that is comfortable and relaxing(or energizing if one is dull/sleepy) or just to observe the breath the way it naturally is.  I would say that anapanasati is more of a mind exercise than a breathing one, since the purpose is to observe the arising and passing of thoughts, feelings, and sensations.  Stopping the flow of discursive thought and becoming absorbed seems to be a primary function, as well as giving one insight into the nature of reality/self.  Who better to learn meditation instruction from than the Buddha himself?  So here's a link to the [Anapanasati sutta](https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/MN/MN118.html)","There is an element of manipulating the breath that is sensitive and calming to fabrication, so requires active involvement. There needs to be some thought, evaluation, 
and discernment about the quality of the breath, and whether or not it could be more comfortable. Controlling the breath has too strong of a connotation, because the point isn't to breath in a preset manner regardless of the condition of the mind and body. The breath is a neutral phenomenon to consolidate the mind around, which can be fabricated make the conditions for the mind and body pleasant, so the work of consolidating the mind is pleasant, and something a person wants to do.","Pranayama is training the breath itself, by using breathing patterns of various fixed lengths and their combinations. At one level, this is healthy, like physical exercise, At another level, the breath is connected to the body's energy system, and breath exercises may activate it after prolonged practice (e.g. via the kundalini.) The breath is strongly connected to the mind, and breathing exercises instill mental discipline and sharpness.

Anapanasati is a mindfulness system that also works to calm the mind.

 The breath mainly works to anchor the mind at one spot, but it also acts as an indicator of the agitation of the mind. One also generates a pleasant energy which also helps to keep the mind focused and alert. Thus, one calms the mind by letting the breath settle down on its own. In this sense, it is a samatha system. 

Watching the breath and other sensations arise and pass away, without trying to exert control or judgement over them, is mindfulness. This way, one becomes aware of our persistent thought process, our reactions, and the mental-physical connections.",,,,,,,,,,

39,,Buddhism,"Apologies for this long text, but context is needed. (TL;DR version in the end)

I‚Äôve been a Buddhist for 3 years, and during  that time I felt a peace that I haven‚Äôt felt for a long time. Before I found Buddhism, I was in a deep existential crisis, always anxious and not able to enjoy and appreciate anything in life. In that regard, Buddhist teachings helped me a LOT, and I‚Äôm deeply grateful for it.

As I learned the basics of Buddhism, some things seemed kinda depressing at first (like ‚ÄúLife is Suffering‚Äù and the concept of ‚Äúnon-attachment‚Äù), but once I read the explanations given by other people on the internet, it made sense and were reassuring. So I learned not to judge the teachings at first glance, started meditating and learning more.

After 3 years, I‚Äôve come to study the Dharma more deeply, reading some verses of the Pali Canon and watching some Buddhist monk‚Äôs explanations of the Dharma and everything was great. However, in these past few months, I started to encounter explanations that seemed very depressing and [nihilistic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKvbH1GRDWQ&amp;t=3s).

At first I thought I was misinterpreting, but the more I read, the more Buddha (and his monks) seem to have a view of existence as nothing but suffering, deprived of any meaning and worthwhile joy. It seems to me that the Buddha wants us to feel like nothing on earth is worth valuing, since everything is impermanent, so we should become detached from everything. It didn‚Äôt help the fact that the goal of reaching Nirvana is to stop rebirth and never have to experience life again, like a practical philosophy to achieve [eternal nothingness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXodPSmC2O4&amp;t=1s).  
This filled me with dread.

The more verses I read in the Pali Canon and the more explanations about the Dharma I read, the more crestfallen and anxious I became. Their ultimate goal (Nirvana) is described as [feeling nothing](https://suttacentral.net/an9.34/en/sujato), and a lot of people described it the [same way](https://buddhism.stackexchange.com/questions/39629/if-buddhas-dont-feel-bliss-what-is-the-purpose-of-attaining-nirvana)  and somehow they see bliss in that. I don‚Äôt!

To me, this seems to be about becoming indifferent to life so that it can‚Äôt hurt you, OR (since I‚Äôm aware that indifference is the ‚Äúnear enemy‚Äù of equanimity) at the very least seemed to be about working on having no wants (ta·πáhƒÅ) or intentions (cetanƒÅ) in life, not even an appreciation for the wonders of life since everything will eventually end, so we should just end our continued existence. (I‚Äôm aware that other schools, like Mahayana and Zen Buddhism, have a different approach to life, but I‚Äôm commenting specifically about the original teachings of the Buddha, the Pali Canon, so this is more directed to Theravada Buddhism.)

To me it seems like this is a complete waste of life‚Äôs rare and precious opportunity, specially since I don‚Äôt really believe in rebirth. The Buddhist belief in rebirth seems to downplay the importance of gratitude and appreciation of life, because you‚Äôve ‚Äúlived it many times before‚Äù. It emphasizes the problem of suffering (cause of cyclic existence), which makes the desire to stop it understandable, but it also seems to completely undermine the value of life. The only reason Buddhism seems to value human life is because it‚Äôs the only creature able to achieve freedom from rebirth. Even if I did believe in rebirth, this still looks like an extreme position to take: wanting to ‚Äúescape‚Äù life.

I know that life is marked by suffering, I know that nothing lasts forever, and I do agree that craving things or wishing for them to last forever will lead to unnecessary suffering and disappointment, so we shouldn‚Äôt obsess over life. That is reasonable! But to have ‚Äú[nothing dear](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.087.than.html)‚Äù at all in life just because everything will eventually pass, seems extremist.

I love my family and friends, and even though I know they will one day die, I don‚Äôt think detaching from them is a reasonable solution. I can understand the relief (and non-anxiety) from not experiencing loss, but I don‚Äôt see any bliss or joy in it. I just see indifference, which only seems blissful if it‚Äôs compared to a view of existence as nothing but suffering. And that's the thing! The Buddha seems like he want us to feel like existence is nothing but suffering so that we can gain ""motivation"" to stop rebirth.

The teachings for lay people are indeed more reasonable, positive and uplifting, but the basis of the Buddhist goal is still ending rebirth (life), which seems so pessimistic that it makes them irrelevant.

The nuance I saw in the Dharma is gone. The balanced explanations I read about Buddhism from other people now just seem like they‚Äôre sugarcoating this underlying pessimism. The teachings in Buddhism, that once made feel calm, make me feel no peace at all now.  In fact, they make me feel nihilistic, the very thing I was trying to solve in my life. Now, I feel almost no joy, and when I try to appreciate things in life, I‚Äôm not able to or I feel guilty when I try. Not even meditation can fully calm me down.

I came to Buddhism in search for acceptance. Acceptance of life‚Äôs joys and sufferings and how to live peacefully WITH them, with no clinging to them (in that sense, philosophy of Taoism makes more sense to me). But now I feel like what I got was a denial of life. I don‚Äôt feel peace anymore. I feel despair.

All this being said, I guess I‚Äôm what I‚Äôm asking for is clarity. I didn‚Äôt come here to have arguments or to mock Buddhism. I came here to know if there is something I‚Äôm missing, or something I didn‚Äôt interpret correctly. If I did, please correct me (references from the Pali Canon that could help explain it and correct me are greatly appreciated)

Thank you for your time and I wish you all happiness in life.

I know it's hard right now with the pandemic going on, and you may not have access to a monastery. But there are online sessions where you can ask questions. Register for an event or straight up message a teacher.

There are regular events at the following places, for example:

[https://anukampaproject.org/events/](https://anukampaproject.org/events/)

[http://alba.amaravati.org/](http://alba.amaravati.org/)

[https://bswa.org/events/](https://bswa.org/events/)

Or you can send a handwritten letter to a monastery of your choosing. Or message a qualified monastic on a forum such as [https://discourse.suttacentral.net/](https://discourse.suttacentral.net/). Don't leave this to strangers on the internet, it's too important.

Best of luck!","Buddhism doesn't preach nihilism. There is a clear highest goal of escaping the cycle of samsara. Not everyone is going to pursue that in this life and lay supporters sometimes have no desire to do so. They still provide critical support for those who do aim for the highest goal. Even if one is not intent on enlightenment in this life, their actions still matter as they produce results in line with those actions.

Check out [this article](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/thanissaro/affirming.html) from Thanissaro Bhikkhu. It mentions some of the things that you are thinking about.","*what am i missing?* 

joy compassion and loving kindness. you're missing half the path.

wisdom and love go hand in in hand - two sides of the same coin. the only response to the impermanence of all things is love and compassion - for all beings, yourself included.

practice loving kindness mindfulness. without joy, love and compassion, the path is just hard and depressing. plenty of teenagers dressed in black with  exactly the same dark outlook.  the buddha's path is distinguished by one of letting go of the things which cause us suffering and developing a sense of love, compassion and kindness. joy is the natural consequence of that.

Some basic instructions for loving kindness are here:

&gt; I have a family and I love them and obviously am extremely attached to them. 

Why, and in what way, are you attached to them?","There is attachment, aversion, and 'release' perhaps you could say.

Attachment is like if you hold something in your hand and your hand is clenched in a fist, not letting it go.

Aversion is like throwing the thing in your hand away, pushing it out of your hand.

Release, so to speak, is like opening your fist.

When it comes to a family, you have the conditions to be part of that family. You don't need to push them away - that is not necessarily 'release', I think that often is aversion.

You can work with your situation as it is with an open hand, not being attached to your family members in the sense that you need them to be a possession of yours, you need them to make you happy, etc, but you can use your situation as an opportunity, for example, to practice the brahmaviharas, to raise quality human beings, to encourage proper virtue perhaps, etc.

This does not require attachment. 

IMO, too many people think that aversion is a virtue. FWIW.",,,,,,,,,,

Loving ourselves is hard. Being kind and generous to ourselves is hard. We live in a culture that thrives on pride and judgement, but these prejudicial habits towards others leaves us with the short end of the stick, and we find that as much as we are critical of others, we are 10x critical of ourselves.

Instead, by learning to be patient and forgiving towards others, by doing good deeds for others selflessly and altruistically, we begin to train ourselves in metta. Then, when the time is appropriate, we can turn those positive habits towards ourselves, and learn generosity, kindness, and forgiveness for our own deeds.

This is the simplest method by which one can overcome regret and anguish for the past: by changing our selfish habits in the present, so that we may learn to love ourselves in the future.","I like TamSanh's response and won't add much to that.

One thing to think about though is the difference between guilt and regret. Guilt takes the mind inward, spiralling toward negative states, and is all based in fantasies of the past.  Regret is a positive state though. It acknowledges past mistakes. It contemplates the past action, the conditions in which happened, and then sets a motivation to do it's best to not repeat that mistaken action.  To regret, is to accept the past for what it was, and to use positive motivation to do better in the future... Even if ""better"" is just not repeating the action.  I hope that helps a little to let go of any shame and worry.",I started to explore loving kindness(metta) meditation during the pandemic. For me an important part to even get the loving kindness feeling going was forgiving myself and others for past mistakes. All kinds of emotions of past mistakes arose to consciousness. It was a rough ride but also very liberating. The memories are still there but the strong emotions associated with the memories have lost their intensity and are no longer as strong.

For me it was an important part of metta meditation.,,,,,,,,,,

Keep the 5 precepts of moral behaviour as a base for mental wellbeing. 

Practice mindfulness - not just on the cushion, but pick an object you can return to throughout the day without issue. Loving kindness is a great object of mindfulness of you're busy and you have a lot on your mind. In my experience, the breath is good if you have a generally calm mind and life. 

For wisdom - see everything that comes to the body and mind in terms of impermanence, lacking a real, reliable self, and as unsatisfactory for genuine happiness. 

That's it.

Some basic instructions for loving kindness are here:

Have some patience, and some faith. Patience because you've only just started. Faith in the Buddha because he did it, and faith in yourself because the Buddha taught, knowing that we can succeed.

Begin first with virtue. Follow the 5 Precepts, undertake acts of generosity, kindness, and compassion. Then, one you have settled in virtue, being with meditation practice. These two will play off of each other; they are not separate, as stated by the great master Huineng. As a result of the practice of these two, wisdom will arise, and you will begin to shed the bad habits just as one sheds scabs when a wound heals. Just like with scabs, you must wait until the wound has fully cured; if you try to scratch the scab off too quickly, you will find your wound reopening. So too, with your negative habits, you must have patience, and if you continue to practice with virtue and concentration, then they will naturally fall off as well.

This is the practice of Buddhism. Put it to the test and see its efficacy on your own.

Because of this, you can put these ideas aside for now and focus on the aspects of the Dharma that you do find useful. In all Buddhist groups I've been to, there's never been any questioning regarding people's beleifs. Practicing together is what matters.","Starting from a point of doubt is probably better than being too sure, it means that you will be openly  inquisitive in examining the teachings.  The Buddha would say ""ehipassiko"", ""come and see"".  Thoroughly test the teachings, practice, and if it works for you, wrong views and bad habits will fall off like dead skin.  It's said that once a certain level of practice in meditation is obtained, you might recollect past lives.  Until then, it is probably best to take what is useful in this moment and apply it.  

""O bhikshus and wise men, just as a goldsmith would test his gold by burning, cutting, and rubbing it, so you must examine my words and accept them, but not merely out of reverence for me.""
‚Äì¬† from the ghanavyuha sutra (Sutra of Dense Array)

‚ÄúOne makes an effort for the abandoning of wrong view &amp; for entering into right view: This is one‚Äôs right effort. One is mindful to abandon wrong view &amp; to enter &amp; remain in right view: This is one‚Äôs right mindfulness. Thus these three qualities‚Äîright view, right effort, &amp; right mindfulness‚Äîrun &amp; circle around right view.""  from the Maha-cattarisaka Sutta: The Great Forty","I have a similar background and found this video to be very helpful.  It teaches how to meditate on physical sensation and how to meditate on sound.  No need to place your faith on anything mystical or spiritual.

Take that from someone who played football in highschool, got a severe head injury and ended up not being able to play the sport I loved for the rest of highschool.

HOWEVER, there is a way to engage in these sports in a healthy manner. This requires effort on your part and I can't hold your hand here, but I'd recommend stepping away from the sports for a bit, apply yourself to meditation, metta, or some wholesome practice. Practice wholesome qualities and when you find that you don't need sports as a condition to be happy or to have as an identity or purpose, id then recommend rengaging with them again.

Edit: there's also a way to turn these things into wholesome activities, for me I turned working out into a meditative practice, which oddly enough kept my workouts safer and healthier.","""Praise and blame, recognition and disregard, gain and loss, pleasure and sorrow come and go like the wind.

67,,Buddhism,"I'm a newcomer to the Buddha's teachings, so apologies in advance if my question seems basic or poorly posed.

It seems to me that one of the main ways humans cope with suffering is to find a meaning in it. For instance, one ascribes a cause for the suffering, such as fate, a decree of God, one's own actions, etc. This is comforting insofar as one thinks one's suffering is necessary, or at least appropriate to the situation. Alternatively, one seeks in the suffering a ""message"" of some sort. They might feel a sense of ""growth"" from their suffering, that they have become stronger or wiser, or have gained some other desirable thing that they would not have obtained without their suffering. I would go as far as to say that most people can accept any kind of suffering, no matter how intense, so long as they can find or generate such a meaning. On the other hand, if one thinks that there is no meaning to their suffering, or at least if they cannot find a meaning, then this itself is a kind of suffering. This suffering of not having a meaning can even be worse than the original suffering about which one lacks a meaning.

In the Mahasatipatthana Sutta, the Buddha states:

&gt;In short, the five aggregates of clinging are suffering.

one of the aggregates of clinging being mental formations. Furthermore, in the same text, the Buddha says:

&gt;The craving for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, mind-objects in the world is agreeable and pleasurable, and there this craving arises and establishes itself.

Certainly, a meaning is an object of the mind, and the search for meaning takes place (if I understand correctly) within the aggregate of mental formations. That is to say, the Buddha seems to be saying that craving for meaning creates an attachment to the aggregate of mental formations, and thus is a source of suffering. Furthermore, the desire to retain meanings one already has is also a source of suffering, as one fears losing their meanings and can suffer grievously upon actually losing them.

My question is twofold:

1. Am I correctly understanding the Buddha's teaching on this point? Do meanings for suffering hold any special value compared to other mental formations?
2. Does the Buddha's teaching on the origin of suffering also constitute a meaning for suffering in the same sense as the examples I used above? It would seem absurd that the Buddha would say that his own teaching is a source of suffering.

However, if we get so drawn to the engine and its fine points that we never leave the engine room during the entire cruise, then what good is there in either the engine or the cruise? The entire trip becomes a waste of energy.

 Even when the person says: ""Full &amp; detailed understanding of the engine will guarantee me a great next cruise"", this cruise right now is wasted, and we have zero guarantees this one hasn't been the only cruise we will ever have...

So, knowing Dharma is great, but if not applied to enhance life, the knowledge on its own is a waste of life.","Suffering seems to be in our mind. It's subjective. We have experiences. If we interpret the experience in a certain way we suffer. If we interpret the experience in a different way we don't suffer and may even grow or benefit from it.

Things are less objective and concrete than we usually think they are.

Teaching that the 5 aggregates are suffering is referring to the 3rd type of suffering, pervasive suffering. We can't fully understand advanced things without first comprehending each step. That's the same with anything that we learn in the world. We may be told an advanced concept in a certain field of study, but even if it's true and we can read the words it doesn't mean anything to us. After studying in the field and later revisiting the concept then it becomes profound to us.

The 3rd type of suffering is an advanced concept. So it's good to first understand the first 2 types of suffering. The suffering of suffering and then the suffering of change.

The origin of suffering also has layers. It's not just one thing, although a lot of it comes down to afflictions, karma and underneath everything ignorance. The Buddha's teachings are teaching the way things exist and contemplating them helps to eradicate our ignorance (the source of our misery).

I'm not too knowledgable about all this myself but that's my brief thoughts.",,,,,,,,,,

Ideally, it'd have all of them, with the censor traditionally burning three sticks of incense for an offering. 

When you have two statues, you generally have the Buddha and their attendant bodhisattva to their left (our right). A triad would place the third bodhisattva to the central Buddha's right.

all means participate in Asian-oriented groups and the like, but we also really need to hear from Buddhists who were raised in Buddhist countries. It would be very beneficial in the long run.  
It's my understanding that American Buddhists especially seem to have a hard time connecting with Asian Buddhist minorites around them, because getting involved with temples serving a minority is too intimidating, and in some contexts people are made to believe that they don't need to understand the cultural context of what they are studying. And on the other side, the presence of ""native"" Buddhists on the English-speaking internet is very small, possibly because it feels to alienating to see people scoff at ""religious stuff"". We need to bridge the gaps so that the Westerners can remedy they partial grasp.

Also, I hope you're safe over there.","I‚Äôm an Asian American Buddhist and I‚Äôm trying to butt into these white-dominant Euro-centric spaces to raise the voice of ‚Äúethnic Buddhism‚Äù and show that the ‚Äúethnic religion‚Äù practiced and taught by us outside of Anglophone contexts is just as sharp, analytical, and sophisticated as theirs. We need more of these voices. 

I‚Äôve been on this sub for seven years now. There are *so many* more Asian voices than there used to be. From all over the world. And it‚Äôs been great to see this growth and this increase in participation in the Anglosphere. 

Is there a disconnect? Yes, absolutely. But we need to keep making ourselves part of the conversation, because they‚Äôre not going to ask or invite us to participate unless we force ourselves into their spaces and make them face the subtle racism of the Buddhist Anglosphere‚Äôs culture.","The internet has very loud American voices everywhere. Even if you go to UK-based subreddits, it's full of Americans discussing our politics and our country with little understanding.

The issue is we need more people sharing diverse information about Buddhism, but it's very difficult on Reddit. What makes it even more difficult, is that people don't tell you what country they're from, which school or which temple, so they could be from anywhere. When they answer a question, they could be talking about any part of Buddhism from any country.

The best thing people from Asia can do is make more posts and comments, sharing their wisdom.",,,,,,,,,,

This traditional commentary is very exhaustive: [https://www.shambhala.com/the-nectar-of-manjushri-s-speech-1087.html](https://www.shambhala.com/the-nectar-of-manjushri-s-speech-1087.html)

Here is another commentary, by Thrangu Rinpoche: [https://namobuddhapub.org/zc/index.php?main\_page=product\_info&amp;cPath=10&amp;products\_id=253](https://namobuddhapub.org/zc/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=10&amp;products_id=253)

Pema Ch√∂dr√∂n also has one. This one is probably more suitable for beginners: [https://www.shambhala.com/becoming-bodhisattvas-15412.html](https://www.shambhala.com/becoming-bodhisattvas-15412.html)","Their weapons and my body ---

Both are causes of my torment!

They their weapons, I my body brandished;

Who then is more worthy of my rage?

However, let's all be careful with how we phrase certain things, and don't be afraid to be blunt and truthful about the unskillful nature of certain activities.

As a youth I was selfish and uncaring towards almost everyone. I had been traumatized from a young age; I'm not sure how or if that played a role. 

I had hit 'rock bottom' in my late teens. One stranger showed me compassion I had never seen from anyone in my life. It wasn't as if everything automatically fell into place, however, since that day I have been drawn closer and closer to Buddhism. Slowly over time I've come a long way from where I was back then.

Empathy is taught in medicine practice to improve healthcare for patients and also in business to improve client relations.

&gt;Everyone knows your income goes into taxes which if you're American goes into the military.

Again, insofar as there is not another option, it seems difficult to explain how the *layperson* is being blameworthy. If you live in a country that is expansionist and has a military which goes and kills people frivolously, etc. that is the fault of generals, politicians, soldiers, etc. They are the ones not following the path. But what blameworthy thing have I done? All we can do is try to exercise what limited control we have over the state of governance so as to make our taxes be used in good ways and not bad ones. If we have done that, and our powers were simply not great enough, that does not seem to be our fault.","Intention is important. People don't get to choose where their tax dollars go. You could compare it to driving a car somewhere. You will likely kill some bugs when you drive a car somewhere, but that doesn't mean that you intentionally caused their deaths. You're didn't get in your car with the intention to kill bugs. With the taxes, your intention is to pay your taxes because you will go to jail if you do not. Your intention is not to bomb XYZ country or anything like that..

Mendicants living off of alms receive that which is freely given by people. The people who give to monastics do so out of their own good will. People give the gift of food, clothing, shelter, medicine.. Monastics give the highest gift of dhamma, when they answer questions from the lay people or teach. It's like a symbiotic relationship. I believe the Buddha set up this system so that the lay people would benefit monastics and monastics would benefit laypeople, which keeps the teachings alive because everyone benefits.","The rule is about monks accepting food or other provisions such as robes or medicine, they aren't allowed to possess money.  If someone is stealing just to give away, the negative karma would belong to the thief, not the monk(unless he knew it was stolen).

  You could refuse to pay taxes and go to prison, where you'll end up working for an even lower wage and profiting those militant states/corporations even more.  The eightfold path applies to the actions that are under our individual control, not what is done with the wealth that is taken from us against our will.  Many sensible Americans are fine with taxes going to build roads and schools, but pretty vocal about our opposition to our taxes being taken for unjust regimes.  Still, what can we do about it? Protest which may lead to some social change, or being shot in the face with rubber bullets, courtesy of our tax money.  Most people are better off keeping themselves and their families safe, living a life doing good where we can, rather than risking our lives trying to stop endless wars.",,,,,,,,,,

&gt;In this discourse, Ajatasattu visits the Buddha in hopes that the latter will bring some peace to his mind. The question he puts to the Buddha shows the limited level of his own understanding, so the Buddha patiently describes the steps of the training, beginning at a very basic level and gradually moving up, as a way of raising the king's spiritual horizons. At the end of the talk, Ajatasattu takes refuge in the Triple Gem. Although his earlier deeds were so heavy that this expression of faith could have only limited consequences in the immediate present, the Commentary assures us that the king's story would ultimately have a happy ending. After the Buddha's death, he sponsored the First Council, at which a congress of arahant disciples produced the first standardized account of the Buddha's teachings. As a result of the merit coming from this deed, Ajatasattu is destined ‚Äî after his release from hell ‚Äî to attain Awakening as a Private Buddha.

Prince is intentionally responsible for his fathers death so he will be born in hell next life, but due to other good conduct he will attain private Buddha status at some point in the future.

I don't post this in praise of not putting in effort however. No point in not giving stream entry a go in this life.","You don't have any guarantee of awakening if you remain a worldling. That's how it is, unfortunately. Even keeping the precepts doesn't guarantee a good destination, as explained in this [sutta](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/tipitaka/mn/mn.136.nymo.html).

The **good news** is that if stream entry seems too difficult to attain, there is reason to think that a faith follower is destined for awakening. A faith follower is essentially someone who has attained the path but not the fruit of stream entry. I used to think this was only said in a couple of suttas, so I didn't take it seriously. But this is actually said in several suttas, including but possibly not limited to SN25.1-SN25.10; MN22; MN34; MN70(ish).

It seems to me that its a bit like a snowball effect. As you inch your way closer to becoming a faith follower, the likelihood of falling off the wagon decreases over time. Until the momentum becomes so stable that you become a faith/Dhamma follower. Then, like a snowball that's about to cause an avalanche, there is no turning back. You will then attain stream entry, on your deathbed at the very latest.",,,,,,,,,,

&lt;p&gt;Then, some 20 years later, I had a near death experience.  In the moment where I thought I was going to die, my mind cried out for God to save me.  During those moments I completely reverted to how I was raised as a child.  I didn&amp;#39;t even consider Buddhist teachings until after I was safe and secure again.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this due to the human nature of fearing death?  Should I meditate on death until I no longer fear it?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Dalai Lama was once quoted saying he didn&amp;#39;t wish people to convert to Buddhism, saying they should stay with the religion they were born into.  Should I just add meditation to Christianity?  I did a guided meditation Youtube with Thich Nhat Hanh and was surprised when he used Buddha and Jesus Christ alternatively during the guided meditation.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know this is a personal choice that I need to make, but I&amp;#39;m wondering if anyone else has had struggles like this and if they&amp;#39;ve found a way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

I don't think that wanting there to be safety from death and hoping it can be given to you by another makes you a Christian. I think it makes you a sentient being.

The Lord Buddha points the path to the taming of the mind, and here is where deathlessness can be found, but until one has seen the deathless for oneself, doubt will not be completely dispensed with. That does not make you not a Buddhist.","The mind was conditioned to think one way. You spend years learning new ways to look at things, but in a moment of fear, you are brought back it a previous state of mind. 

There is nothing detrimental here. 

Someone overweight one day decides to get in better shape. They spend years reconditioning their body into a healthier versions. One day they get the urge to eat something completely unhealthy that haven't had in years. 

Did this person fail? 


We tend to be hard on ourselves. Show compassion for yourself, and carry on with your practice. One cheeseburger isn't going to make you balloon out.","I was raised uber-Christian as well. You didn't mention it in your post, but is it possible that you cried to God for help due to the fear of Hell? My opinion is that the concept of Hell is a traumatizing one, particularly to those with vivid imaginations. When death is impending, our fear reflexes can take over and traumatic fears about death (such as the possibility of going to Hell) might surface along with a corresponding former method of alleviation of that fear (asking for God's help/forgiveness). Just a thought.",,,,,,,,,,

Just to be sure though. When you say ""Kadampa lineage"", do you mean the New Kadampa Tradition founded by the expulsed geshe, Sonam Gyaltsen?

In general, if you're preparing for death, I would recommend not looking for special, difficult, ""high"" teachings.

And to be honest, *without* to bodhichitta, no *kyerim* or *dzogrim* methods are gonna be of any use.

I am not sure if they are on average more tolerant and respectful of other cultures and religions than people in general, but I hope you are right.

&gt;But what do most Buddhists today personally think of Islam in general?

Presumably there is not a position shared by ""most Buddhists"" on Islam.

&gt;do they believe it needs to be changed or reformed? Do they believe that it is inherently peaceful or otherwise, as is frequently debated in some Western soceities?

Again, I doubt there is a position of most Buddhists. I will leave it to Muslims to decide whether Islam should be changed, because presumably they have a better sense of what is to be done about Islamic matters than I do. I think the ""religion of peace"" debate is useless; I do not believe the actual root causes of religious violence stem from particular religious ideologies in today's world, but rather that violence originates in dependence on various other political and material factors.

&gt;Does it have a generally positive or negative effect on human enlightenment and growth, in your personal opinion? 

I cannot say, because I don't know what a world without it would look like, so I could not tell you whether that world would have more ""human enlightenment and growth"" or not. Presumably we could point to specific actions of Muslims that we believe originated primarily because of those people following Islam and say they are good actions or bad ones, but only the omniscient could know the sum total of all these deeds and their effects on the world.","I can speak as an ex-muslim who's spent a decade studying and thinking about religions. I can also speak from my own observations of muslims, how they relate to religion and their understanding of religion. This goes for every religion stemmed from Judaism. When you study Judaism, you understand something very clearly: this is not (merely) a religion, it's an ideology for a state in theocratic form. You can't really seperate state from religion. And my interpretation is this is stemming from thousand of years old tradition of god-kingdoms in the middle east. Until very recently every kind of state in ME based their legitimacy on god and holy books. Even now in so called ""democratic"" muslim countries this tradition is alive as a strong undercurrent in politics. So my view is this: islam is mainly a state ideology,a vision for a very particular form of theocratic state. It's only a religion on the side, as a source of legitimacy for the caliphet. So when you think of islam, you should be thinking of a very specific hierarchical political organization formed under a caliph. How individual muslims behave in a western democracy where they are extreme minority, would be a very low resolution view of islam. It'd be similar to saying: I have a friend who is a communist and he's good guy so communism must be pretty good huh?

For muslims religion is an identity: like race, ancestry etc. They're born with it and they go with the herd, there's nothing more to it than that even tho they like to pretend there is more to it. When you disassemble their arguments they retreat back to their core view of religion: it's a very strong view of identity. And this is more or less the case for most forms of organised religion, even in some forms of Buddhism. But Buddhism is the only religion where you're supposed to let go of views and identities, it's pretty much the antithesis of other forms of ""religion"". There is an interesting observation for you: when I speak to muslims and ex-muslims about Buddhism and explain it, they say: it's not a religion then. Their view of religion is something like this: a particular political vision combined with a strong identity and a set of dogmas you have to believe. You can say this is religion or Buddhism is religion. But you can't say they're both religions. In my opinion, as the Buddha suggested, Buddhism is the only religion. Other ""religions"" are not alternatives to Buddhism, they're forms of self identifications combined with political views. I believe people who truly are interested in religion will eventually find their way to Buddhadhamma in this life or the next.",[deleted],,,,,,,,,,

94,,Buddhism,"I recently have been engaged in some discussion on this topic and I felt to post on it.

In brief, I initially responded to following:

&gt; Celibacy is a restraint that is conducive to awakening, and is practiced by those serious about awakening.

I said,

&gt; It is not appropriate to say this categorically.

Responses and other statements have included,

&gt; I provided two suttas that unambiguously demonstrate that the Buddha did teach that sex is categorically a hindernce that is to be abandoned.

and

&gt; The middle way of the Buddha is celibacy. Laypeople in sexual relationships are by definition not living the middle way.

Now, in general, when it comes to categorical statements, that means that there are no exceptions by definition, otherwise it is not categorical.

For example, if we consider gravity to categorically function and we even find one instance of, say, releasing a bowling ball and it flying upwards without any other force acting on it, then we cannot say that gravity categorically functions - a single exception acts basically as a single needle the pops the balloon of the categorical statement.

Now, in the Theravada tradition, when it comes to stream winners, regarding their virtue it says things like,

&gt; He/she is endowed with virtues that are appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to concentration.

It also says, 

&gt; what does it mean to be consummate in virtue? There is the case where a noble disciple abstains from taking life, abstains from stealing, abstains from illicit sexual conduct, abstains from lying, abstains from taking intoxicants that cause heedlessness. This is called being consummate in virtue.

The Buddha‚Äôs chief female patron was Visakha, who I believe realized stream entry as a 7 year old child and later, at 15, got married and ultimately had 20 children. This would of course clearly imply non-celibacy.

I believe it‚Äôs generally considered that King Bimbisara was also a stream winner who continued to rule the kingdom and was non-celibate. 

It seems potentially implied that Nakulapita and Nakulamata also lived together as a married couple for many years and had children with at least Nakulamata being a stream winner, although I‚Äôm not sure that the timing of stream entry and sexual intercourse is explicit.

For instance.

Regardless, if even just Visakha was non-celibate and a stream winner, and if we accept that a stream winner‚Äôs virtue is categorically,

&gt; appealing to the noble ones: untorn, unbroken, unspotted, unsplattered, liberating, praised by the wise, untarnished, leading to concentration.

Then it would appear to me that I was in fact correct in saying that it is inappropriate to categorically say that celibacy is

&gt; practiced by those serious about awakening.

and it would be also inappropriate to categorically say things like,

&gt; The middle way of the Buddha is celibacy. Laypeople in sexual relationships are by definition not living the middle way.

Am I incorrect in any of my analysis here, in regard to standard accepted premises in the Theravada school?

‚ÄúThere are not just one hundred such laymen enjoying sensual pleasures who are my disciples, Vaccha, or two or three or four or five hundred, but many more than that.‚Äù

...

...If Master Gotama and the monks were the only ones to succeed in this teaching, not any nuns ‚Ä¶ celibate laymen ‚Ä¶ laymen enjoying sensual pleasures ‚Ä¶ celibate laywomen ‚Ä¶

laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures, then this spiritual path would be incomplete in that respect. But because Master Gotama, monks, nuns, celibate laymen, laymen enjoying sensual pleasures, celibate laywomen, and laywomen enjoying sensual pleasures have all succeeded in this teaching, this spiritual path is complete in that respect.

Just as the Ganges river slants, slopes, and inclines towards the ocean, and keeps pushing into the ocean, in the same way Master Gotama‚Äôs assembly‚Äîwith both laypeople and renunciates‚Äîslants, slopes, and inclines towards extinguishment, and keeps pushing into extinguishment.

-MN 73","I tend to agree with your thinking as there is/were numerous stream enterers who were clearly non celibate, so this statement:

&gt;The middle way of the Buddha is celibacy. Laypeople in sexual relationships are by definition not living the middle way.

Is not entirely accurate. Can celibacy help push you forward on the path faster? Probably, but to state celibacy is a necessity, even for a lay follower, if they want to follow the middle way, seems to be an extreme viewpoint. MN 73 is also clearly against this statement.","A SotƒÅpanna according to the Theravada tradition is able to engage in sexual activities. You are probably interpreting wrongly the stages of enlightenment.

AnƒÅgƒÅmi is the stage where sensual desire is abandoned and therefore sexual activity is not possible.

As for being a celibate to be beneficial for awakening... It‚Äôs beneficial because you train yourself to sit with desires instead of running from them.

To refresh or clear up your understanding of the 4 stages of enlightenment you can watch this dhamma talk. Ajahn Sona touches the topic of celibacy in it too in the stages.

There are some things we know better now. For instance, Theravada Buddhism entered Vietnam from the south through Champa before the Chinese spread Mahayana Buddhism southward. There's also consistent Mahayana transmission from Srivijaya into Vietnam, and north from there to Chengdu.

It also seems silly to assume that Theravada was able to sail from Sri Lanka to Ayutthaya, but at no point transmitted to Srivijaya, as if they couldn't turn their boats.

There's also some reductionism, since the red line is really not as clearcut as just 'Mahayana', as many sravaka schools also transmitted themselves from Gandhara/Bactria into China and as far as Korean.

but yeah, pretty much.","I think there is some inaccuracies and gross simplification on the map. For example, the map shows Vajrayana as going from India to Tibet, then to China, and Japan. This is inaccurate. As far as I know, the Vajrayana that is more dominant in historical China and Japan came via the middle east similar to the Mahayana route.

&gt;Precious trees fit to offer to the victors,  
Abound there, branches laden with fruit ‚Äî  
Their leaves and flowers fragrant and blossoming,  
Graced with the scent of incense and mist on the breeze.

&gt;Cascades of water descend with the gentle rumble of bass drums.  
The hills above are bathed in the coolness of the moon  
And covered with a thick robe of clouds,  
Above which shine the stars and constellations in their perfect beauty.  

&gt;Flocks of geese glide above fresh smelling ponds and  
Birds and deer roam freely about.  
Bees buzz melodiously everywhere among the  
Lotus and utpala flowers, among the wish-fulfilling trees.  

&gt;The trees sway, dancing back and forth, back and forth,  
And the tips of their branches bow,  
As if lovingly welcoming guests,  
Saying, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre glad you‚Äôve come!‚Äù

&gt;The cool, pure ponds are covered with lotus flowers  
Whose faces are bright as if smiling upon us.  
Surrounding are groves of flowers and trees  
And grassy meadows holding the robes of the sky.  
All of this shining like the stars on a clear night  
Or gods playing in pleasure groves.

&gt;While the cuckoo sings his intoxicating, piercing song,  
And the flowers sway in the cool seasonal breeze,  
Cloud-elephants trumpet their joy  
And the appearance of rain heralds cooling goodness.

&gt;In all four seasons,  
Guiltless subsistence can be had  
From readily available fruit, leaves, and roots.

&gt;In the woods, the afflictions naturally subside  
For there is no one to say unpleasant things.  
Having gone far from busy cities,  
In the woods, peaceful meditation naturally grows.  
In the woods, the mind is tamed as it conforms to the true Dharma,  
And one can find the bliss of inner peace.

&gt;In short, the charms of the wildwoods are endless ‚Äî  
Even if I had eons, I could not conclusively extol them.

&gt;The attainment of awakening by all the victors of the three times  
Only occurs when staying in the wildwoods ‚Äî  
Never in stressful cities and countries.

Connections between quantum mechanics and the Madhyamaka tenet of emptiness are occasionally brought up, but I found this paper interesting because it expresses with mathematical precision what I imagine is the primary parallel from the perspective of one of the most notable quantum theorists.

Here are a couple of relevant excerpts:

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;As indicated in Section 2, the quantum theory understood through the causal interpretation implies the need for a radical change from the classical notion of analyzability of the world into independently existent parts, each of which can be studied in relative isolation, without our having to consider the whole, and which can in turn be put together conceptually to explain this whole. Rather, the basic qualities and relationships of all the ‚Äúelements‚Äù appearing in the theory are now seen to be generally dependent on the state of the whole, even when these are separated by distances of macroscopic order. However, when the wave function can be expressed approximately as a product of functions of coordinates of different ‚Äúelements‚Äù, then these latter will behave relatively independently. But such a relative independence of function is only a special case of general and inseparable dependence. So we have reversed the usual classical notion that the independent ‚Äúelementary parts‚Äù of the world are the fundamental reality and that the various systems are merely particular contingent forms and arrangements of these parts. Rather, we say that inseparable quantum interconnectedness of the whole universe is the fundamental reality and that relatively independently behaving parts are merely particular and contingent forms within this whole.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;Classically, it has been supposed that we can eventually arrive at subsystems (e.g., elementary particles) whose basic qualities and relationships are independent of the states of the systems and supersystems in which they participate. But, quantum mechanically, as we have seen, we cannot arrive at such an analysis. Nevertheless, this distinction into supersystem, system, and subsystem is still both meaningful and useful. However, its role is not to give an analysis into constituent parts, but rather to serve as a basis of description, **which does not imply the independent existence of the ‚Äúelements‚Äù that are distinguished in this description** (e.g., as we may describe a ruler as divided into yards, feet, or inches, without implying that the ruler is ultimately constituted of separately existent ‚Äúelementary inches‚Äù that have been put together in some kind of interaction).

That said: I think it's really neat when the two happen to agree. I've used my current understanding of our current understanding of quantum fields to explain emptiness to people who are wholly unfamiliar with emptiness or how/why it makes perfect, rational sense. There's a lot we could talk about to that end.

If any given particle is just an excitation in a quantum field, then that means even particles are ""empty"" of particle-ness. Heck, we're even told that the idea of particles and waves is just a metaphor and we shouldn't take it literally. There aren't discreet little units of energy floating around that are sometimes little balls and sometimes waves; what they mean is depending on how we measure things, we might measure them as something that's *like* a particle or *like* a wave. It's not that, say, photons are shifting between two ""states"". ""Particles"" and ""waves"" are just metaphors to help scientists and the public talk about these things.

Imagine plucking a guitar string. The place where you plucked it is where we'd say ""particle"" is, but of course it could be anywhere along that vibrating string, and that vibrating string isn't just a single location of vibration - those vibrations propagate outward *like a wave*.

Emptiness and this understanding of materiality line up very well, and I think that's really cool.","The foundation of Buddhism is actually the truth of this reality. 
According to Buddhism, when you analyze reality, you will not find a single object or a fundamental object that can stand alone. There is no such fundamental particle or fundamental substance. 
If this reality is eventually false, Buddhism will collapse. 

In other religion, they throw all this kind of stuff into God stuff, the Creator stuff. Buddhism doesn‚Äôt have God at it's fundamental foundation. Buddhist foundation is on the reality itself. As science also goes into that direction, both Buddhism and science will eventually arrive at the same conclusion. 

It is just a matter of time.","Quantum mechanics says basically is something is not being observed by a sentient being then it is in a superposition. Once matter is observed it collapses the wave function and basically comes into existence. If a tree falls in the forest, and no one is around, does it make a sound? Truth is the tree doesnt even exist until observed.",,,,,,,,,,

In general, in dharma training we let go of fixed ideas about ourselves rather than developing complicated new ones. In some sense, thinking we've got everything coming to us and thinking we deserve nothing are both self-centered ways of thinking. 

A few things that come to mind that might be of use here:

The path is gathering merit as well as wisdom. You could consider focusing on the merit side a bit more: making offerings, doing prostrations, cleaning the temple toilet, volunteer work, reciting praises and so on. Also, training in unbiased loving kindness and compassion might be suitable.

And maybe regarding my first line: if you don't have a teacher, you could try looking for one, and for a community to take part in and practice with. 

A last point maybe, very generally: my Teachers' Teacher would often point out that his western students were quite obsessed with how their practice made them feel. If we feel good, that is because we did the practice right. If we feel bad, it is because we did the practice wrong. Etc. I think this kinda made him laugh. It's maybe more easygoing to just let feelings and other thoughts come and go without grasping them, and approach the practice not so much as a worldly activity where we have to chase results and avoid mistakes, and constantly think about and judge ourselves. 

Really, we don't have to get rid of this or any other feeling. We can just stop poking at it, remain freshly present and aware, and like literally any other phenomenon, this feeling will fade and other feelings will come up. They're not about us, we're (in as much as we are anything to begin with) are not about them. We can just let go, let be.

Anyway, only some thoughts. Good luck!","I think the best course of action usually prescribed here is to find a teacher to discuss these things with.

Monastics leading live-streamed discussions have never been more prevalent than they are now, if you care to look for them.","I think you're on the right track, but you're missing some development in your wisdom. Things *do* matter, and your place in the grand scheme if thing is anything *but* insignificant and you definitely *are* worthy of this life. What's missing here are teachings on the significance of the ""Precious Human Life"" and the importance of recognizing our virtues.

There's sometimes what feels like a paradox in Buddhism: We're simultaneously told that this body isn't anything special (it's made of meat and water and bone and in the blink of a cosmic eye, it'll decay into worm food) *and* this body is the universe itself and presents a rare and precious opportunity to study, practice, and understand the Dharma and we shouldn't squander this chance to find the path.

These things are simultaneously true, and what they have in common is being realistic about our human condition. We shouldn't be inappropriately attached to this body because it's only temporary and prone to injury and pain, but this body is also very useful so we should make use of it while we have it.

The same could be said about any of the aggregates: perception, feeling, volition, consciousness.

When we make progress on the path and become a little wiser, a little kinder, a little more aware, then we should smile at that. We're on our way. It's said Buddhas definitely celebrate that. It's true we have to be careful about not letting this inflate our ego, that we shouldn't let this cause us to think about how ""great"" we are because this isn't about us as individuals, this is about everyone; all sentient beings across all universes. Every time a Buddha realizes full awakening, things get better for everyone; so every small step we take along the path is a wonderful thing and it's okay to acknowledge that.",,,,,,,,,,

It's about not attaching your happiness or self-identity or self-value to the achievement of the goal.

If you attach emotionally to the achievement of the goal you are attaching to an artifical construct. 

Working towards a goal without attachment to the result frees you from fear of failure and frustration which provides more energy and mental focus for actually achieving the goal.

Added:

Also there is nothing inherently wrong with being attached.

It just means there are different consequnces, often unpleasant, but also often pleasant, when you attach to goals.

True freedom is not necessarily in being free from attachment, per se, but in choosing freely to be attached or not. Not being a slave to your attachments","Letting go doesn't mean rejecting. 

In the context of making music, for example, letting go could mean accepting that your music might suck. Or that it doesn't, but that everybody else disagrees. 

You could say that letting doesn't necessarily mean not wanting things. It means not getting emotionally invested in hope/expectation and fear/worry. In a way you could say that by letting go, we can do what we do wholeheartedly, rather than for the sake of some theoretical pay off that really only exists because we made it up in the first place. 

To let go of our dreams, we recognize them as dreams. And then, to paraphrase my Guru, we go do wonderful things!

Just some thoughts.","There are desires that are skillful and part of the path. Those are to be cultivated. There are desires that pull you away from it and make you do things you'll regret later. Those are to be uprooted and abandoned. 

Remember that the Buddha laid out instructions for two different kinds of followers: those living as monks dedicating their entire lives to enlightenment and those living as laypeople with everyday responsibilities. It sounds like you're not someone drawn to renunciant life, so if you wish to benefit from Buddhism, try to focus your practice not on abandoning ALL desires, but on developing the 10 perfections in the course of your every day life.

Now, from one side I am saying you to listen your enemy‚Äôs sound. From the other side I am saying you to listen your friend‚Äôs sound.

Then your view becomes moderate. And now you are listening to both.

The person who explores the universal truth is such kind of a person.

&lt;p&gt;He isn‚Äôt bustled &amp;amp; biased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Buddhas‚Äô preach to become impartial &amp;amp; not to get biased. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A person with a bias mind is unable to explore the universal truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That person does not manifest the enlightment. He does not inherit the salvation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He can never achieve a peaceful mind. His view isn‚Äôt moderate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say you first of all, make your view a moderate. That means, keep listening what someone is saying. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, if you want to defeat your enemy, you should listen to the enemy first. You should know what he is saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first thing to be done in order to understand the friendship of your friend is, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;be alert &amp;amp; pay your attention on what your friend is saying.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The both,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;listening to your enemy and your friend, should be done at once. Then your view becomes moderate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Never do inattention when you hear the voice of your enemy. That sound may include the resonance of that enemy‚Äôs defeat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, always give your ears to the sound of your enemy &amp;amp; to the sound of your friend as well. Because, the sound of your friend may include the friendship which you haven‚Äôt understood so far.&lt;/p&gt;

What we experience right now is clear, if we aren't scattered, and we can be simply aware of that.

Just a thought. You could look into the four foundations of mindfulness for more context.","There is only thing which is obvious enough to be in the present moment. The idea is to focus on the MOST obvious thing in the present moment. Let's say you are meditating and you hear a loud sounds outside. You may shift your attention from breathing (for example) to hearing. When the sounds subsides, you come back to the breathing or whatever your meditation object is. 

The thing is most of the times you will lost in thoughts and so you need to mentally note ""thinking"", ""thinking"" everytime you get lost in thoughts and bring your mind back to the present moment.

107,,Buddhism,"I lived my entire life up a few years ago as a hardcore atheist scientist who mocked religion as just being about fairy-tales to build churches until I one day actually bothered my ass to study what Buddhism was all about.

As I was studying it I came across a quote. The name of the person unfortunately escapes me. The quote was ""Believe in the Buddha or don't believe in the Buddha. Do the practice and see the results for yourself."" which struck a chord with me because it was a scientific statement.

So I studied further and tried to align my life as much as possible to the Noble Eightfold Path. One of my favorite things about Buddhism is the Three Marks of Existence, the Three Poisons and the Four Immeasurables. These descriptions are truly wise and I was a fool for not practicing being mindful of these as much as possible during my daily experiences in order to grow wiser.

I did what a good scientist and mathematician would do. I took these most basic constructs as axioms and theorems and then repeated the acts. I held them up like a lens to my experience in the world and I saw how these wisdoms applied transcendentally to all phenomena and wholesome human efforts.

Years down the line now I am ten times better off and I feel so much more peaceful and useful to other people now that I have shed my skin and made the correct choices and cast away the ignorance of relying too much on modern knowledge of science and popular psychology which eclipsed any real possibility for wisdom to arise.

It strikes me as really odd (and admittedly a little bit frustrating) that all my other colleagues in science don't find Buddhism interesting because it truly is marvelous to put it into practice and it made me grow up very quickly. In fact, I almost actually went totally crazy for real when I just started meditating and being mindful and I believe that it was my mind shaking off the sheer weight of misunderstanding. That is how powerful this practice is.

I adore being able to actually be skillful and help people. It is truly a higher calling and it is the one thing I do that brings me the greatest satisfaction out of anything else.

was raised Southern Baptist. Started questioning that around 28 years old and became an agnostic atheist at 33.

I can't remember where I saw this, but this is what got me to check into Buddhism.

&gt;‚ÄúDo not believe in anything simply because you have heard it. Do not believe in anything simply because it is spoken and rumored by many. Do not believe in anything simply because it is found written in your religious books. Do not believe in anything merely on the authority of your teachers and elders. Do not believe in traditions because they have been handed down for many generations. But after observation and analysis, when you find that anything agrees with reason and is conducive to the good and benefit of one and all, then accept it and live up to it.‚Äù - Kalama Sutta

This seemed to counter every other religions I had come across that basically said the exact opposite of what's above.

So, I didn't have to believe a set of dogma? You mean, I could test these things out for myself and if they worked great and if not great find something else? What...freedom...is this? :)

I've not looked back from that moment. I love the teachings and philosophy of Buddhism. It makes crystal clear sense and I know I am kinder, happier, more at peace, and maybe even a little wiser since starting the practice.","Wow, this is beautiful. I came from a very similar stance, albeit I was fortunate enough to find Buddhism before I was into a career.

In fact, I showed interest in high school and mentioned it to my teacher who said it was ‚Äúimpossible,‚Äù because we lack that community in our area (US).

Years later, I, too, went from a bitter atheist to a dedicated Buddhist through what I can only say is good karma and compatibility.

It helped me get over literal trauma (intermittent yet recurring nightmares that recap an event), blinding anger (I came from an emotionally negligent home and was all but left on my own by the time I was 19), and much of the ego that followed that.

It shocked me when one day i thought of my mother and was not filled with vile hatred but instead understanding and a sense of ‚ÄúI can do more to not make us both suffer.‚Äù

I am so thankful you‚Äôve found similar peace to myself. Vipassana is a blessing, as are most other Theravada sects.

Mahayana sects take all the more effort, in my eyes, and I‚Äôd praise anyone doubly for finding such results from its practice.",Is there any advice you would give or materials you would recommend to a young person just starting to get interested in Buddhism?,,,,,,,,,,
108,,Buddhism,"We seldom hear (almost never hear) from Theravada that Dependent Arising is empty. That is not Theravada language. It is Mahayana stuff, the core of Mahayana, explained by Nagarjuna.

Theravada is not a path that you analyze Sutta deeply with logic. THat is Mahayana stuff. Theravada does not explain emptiness as deep as Mahayana in terms of writing. Ajahn Chah said your mind will explode. Theravada approach is through practice.

Mahasi Sayadaw meditation is written by himself from his extensive Pali knowledge. There are many meditation books written by him. One of them is here:

[https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/progress.html#ch6.5](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/mahasi/progress.html#ch6.5)

His meditation is using Vipassana as the path, instead of using Jhana as the path. Because of that, it is very interesting to see how someone's wisdom opens up through the way.

He said that at the beginning, a practitioner can only observe the arising of objects. They have no ability to observe the dissolution of objects. This doesn't mean that he cannot see thoughts appear, stay for a while, and dissolve. His meaning of the dissolution of objects at the advanced level is very deep.

Before the practitioners reach that advanced level, the practitioner will reach a state where he will see many kinds of light, strong equanimity and though he has completed the journey (No. 4 - Knowledge of Arising and Passing Away - The ten corruptions of Insight). Although this is a corruption stage, there is no doubt that this by itself is already an advance meditation stage.

At the higher stage ""Knowledge of Dissolution"", the meditator will eventually realize Dependent Arising is empty. Mahasi Sayadaw didn't write like that, but the meaning is like that. In his own words ""Knowledge of Dissolution"":

&gt;**For at that time each object that is being noticed seems to him to be entirely absent or to have become non-existent.** Consequently, at this stage of knowledge, it seems to him as if he were engaged in noticing something which has already become absent or non-existent by having vanished; and the consciousness engaged in noticing appears to have lost contact with the object that is being noticed. **It is for that reason that a meditator may here think: ""I have lost the insight""; but he should not think so**.  
&gt;  
&gt;....  But now that his knowledge has developed in the way described, no such idea of the formations' features or structure appears to him, still less any other, cruder concept.  .... At such a stage, the *arising* of formations, that is, the first phase of the process, is not apparent (as it is in the case of knowledge of arising and passing away), but there is apparent only the dissolution, that is, the final phase, having the nature of vanishing.

It is interesting to see here, that no matter how you see the formation, previously you will see 3 phases - the arising, stay for a while, and dissolution. But here, no matter how you see, you only see the last, the dissolution, without seeing the first and the middle.

It is so amazing that for whatever you try to see the formation, you only see dissolution. Basically, you continuously fail to see objects in that dependent arising. It is so amazing until you think ""I have lost the insight.""

Actually, he doesn't lose the insight. Instead, he has come to the real nature of dependent arising like he never knew before.

This emptiness involves both the object and the mind (the observer). The practitioner doesn't see both of them anymore. Both subject and object don't appear.

In any dependent arising, by default it is objectless, it is empty in any directions. Empty of object and subject.

In another book (Manual of Insight), Mahasi said that for high practitioners, when you move your hand, say from left to right, you will think there is this hand that is moving from left to right. But for high practitioners, there is no such notion.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;... Even the arm no longer appears to permanently exist. Furthermore the noting mind no longer appears as somebody who is aware, as it usually does for ordinary people. ....

For Theravada practitioners who do not reach this stage by practice, they will not understand this. Why? Because they do not study emptiness as extensively as what Nagarjuna taught in Mahayana. They will not understand this conceptually. As for Mahayana, they may understand this conceptually, but they may not have the direct experience of it unless their meditation is really up to that level.

Mahasi said:

&gt;....one should clearly understand that one cannot abandon the concept of solidity before insight knowledge of dissolution has been attained.

Nagarjuna said

&gt;I prostrate to the Perfect Buddha,  
&gt;  
&gt;The best of teachers, who taught that  
&gt;  
&gt;Whatever is dependently arising is  
&gt;

I think it would generally be speculative to posit that most humans are destined for a worse rebirth, and it's more important to just focus on your practice.

I don't know if I believe in rebirth, but if I did, that is a strong reason to be patient and respectful of every human, no matter what their future birth might be!","The baby‚Äôs soul is NOT purer than the average person‚Äôs soul. This is nonsense according to Buddhism. You are proposing some fatalistic doctrine which is AGAINST the Buddha Dharma. 

You can purify yourself here and now. This will very quickly if you do it long enough make you even purer than when you were born. How do you do that?

Take the Five Precepts here and now. Practice the Five Precepts here and now. Feel remorse and shame for breaking the Five Precepts and retake it. Commit to the Five Precepts. This is purifying.

Perform dana diligently. Gift things that are permissible like food, hygiene products etc.. to monks and nuns. Share your food or stuff with others. Feed the fish and animals. This is purifying and if you do this diligently enough you will probably be purer than when you were born.

Practice loving kindness meditation. This is very purifying. It is so purifying you would have a heavenly rebirth if you died doing loving kindness meditation. 

Practice mindfulness meditation. Even a moment of mindfulness according to the Dhammapadha is more useful than a thousand years of mindless life.

Now it does not matter what happens to the average person‚Äôs soul. YOU ARE NOT average, you seem to have the opportunity to hear the Dharma. This did not happen by accident. People do not hear the Dharma by accident. They hear the Dharma because of past cause that have led them this way. So start purifying yourself. 

The average person ... who knows? An average Christian who does charitable deed and practice moral deeds are likely to also end up purer. A libertine on the other hand is likely to end up more defiled. 

However as a person who has heard the Buddha Dharma .. you should end up purer since you know how to be purer.",,,,,,,,,,

With that said, that's not to say that they have no virtue, and at a point they may be reborn in a higher realm, and basically speaking if they are fortunate, that higher rebirth will be one in which they can connect with the Dharma more fully.

In the meantime, like /u/Hot4Scooter said, you might make prayers/mantras/aspirations/etc for animals to sort of establish a connection with them and/or help them connect to virtue, etc.",There are stories of animals hanging around monasteries/monks and being reborn as human after.

In Hinduism, a permanent self exists which merely associates for a time with a material body, exchanging material bodies birth after birth. The metaphor used in the Bhagavad Gita is like changing clothes. Suffering comes from bondage to the material world (maya), and liberation (moksha) is realizing that the self is not the body, and returning to the realm of pure consciousness (brahaman).

I'm still trying to wrap my head around the anatman concept in Buddhism. If there is no self, what is reborn? What accrues karma? What is One Mind in Zen? But that's another story.",,,,,,,,,,,

Trauma is a hard thing to deal with. Fortunately, in my life I haven't dealt with violence. But, I have been hurt by people I've trusted. Every one is who they are because of what happened to them, and everyone acts out of their own place of suffering. You don't have to like the people who hurt you, but you can feel compassion for them, and treat them with equanimity. Feeling compassion for others isn't something you do for them, it is something you do for yourself. Hate is toxic. So, I don't hate the people who hurt me, but I know I need to stay away from them.

I listened a Dhamma talk about this yesterday. The right view is seeing violent people as sick. Violent people harm themselves a lot more than the people they're hurting. They don't realize it because their perception is impaired, they're sick. We are all sick in this way. We may not be able to cure other people but we can cure ourselves.","We deal with it by following the Noble Eightfold Path. The Buddha understood the violence and evil of the world as a recurring theme better than anyone, yet he didn't turn inward and get upset over it. He didn't make it about himself, he simply learned to understand the world and why things are the way they are. 

Even the Buddha who was completely freed from dukkha was still physically attacked on numerous occasions. Even if we follow the Noble Eightfold Path, we'll likely still be attacked at some point whether physically, verbally or even mentally. 

When the Buddha was insulted, he compared it to being offered food and not accepting it, the food remains in the possession of the one offering it. The Buddha wouldn't cling to anything at all, and that's why he was not bothered by things like insults. We get bothered by them when we hear them and then take them personally (craving, clinging, born of wrong views and ignorance).",,,,,,,,,,

As a result of this evil deed, he was destined not only to be killed by his own son ‚Äî Udayibhadda (mentioned in the discourse) ‚Äî but also to take immediate rebirth in one of the lowest regions of hell.  
&gt;  
&gt;In this discourse, Ajatasattu visits the Buddha in hopes that the latter will bring some peace to his mind. The question he puts to the Buddha shows the limited level of his own understanding, so the Buddha patiently describes the steps of the training, beginning at a very basic level and gradually moving up, as a way of raising the king's spiritual horizons. At the end of the talk, Ajatasattu takes refuge in the Triple Gem. Although his earlier deeds were so heavy that this expression of faith could have only limited consequences in the immediate present, the Commentary assures us that the king's story would ultimately have a happy ending. After the Buddha's death, he sponsored the First Council, at which a congress of arahant disciples produced the first standardized account of the Buddha's teachings. As a result of the merit coming from this deed, Ajatasattu is destined ‚Äî after his release from hell ‚Äî to attain Awakening as a Private Buddha.

&gt; The denotation of the term TheravƒÅda is fraught with controversy. Buddhaghosa‚Äôs commentaries to the four PƒÅli NIKƒÄYAs typically refer to himself and his colleagues as MAHƒÄVIHƒÄRAVƒÄSIN (lit. ‚ÄúDweller in the Great Monastery‚Äù), the name of the then dominant religious order and ordination lineage in Sri Lanka; in his fifth-century commentary to the PƒÅli VINAYA, the SAMANTAPƒÄSƒÄDIKƒÄ, Buddhaghosa uses the term TheravƒÅda, but in reference not to a separate school but to a lineage of elders going back to the first Buddhist council (see SA·πÇGƒ™TI; COUNCIL, FIRST). According to some accounts, the term TheravƒÅda is equivalent to the Sanskrit term *STHAVIRAVƒÄDA (‚ÄúSchool of the Elders‚Äù), which is claimed to have been transmitted to Sri Lanka in the third century BCE. However, the term SthaviravƒÅda is not attested in any Indian source; attested forms (both very rare) include sthƒÅvira or sthƒÅvarƒ´ya (‚Äúfollowers of the elders‚Äù). In addition, the Tibetan and Sinographic renderings of the term both translate the Sanskrit term *STHAVIRANIKƒÄYA, suggesting again that SthaviravƒÅda or TheravƒÅda was not the traditional designation of this school. By the eleventh century CE, what is today designated as the TheravƒÅda became the dominant form of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, achieving a similar status in Burma in the same century, and in Cambodia, Thailand, and Laos by the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. As a term of self-designation for a major branch of Buddhism, TheravƒÅda does not come into common use until the early twentieth century, with ƒÄNANDA METTEYYA playing a key role.  
In the nineteenth century, the Buddhism of Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia was typically referred to in the West as ‚ÄúSouthern Buddhism,"" [...] ‚ÄúSouthern Buddhism‚Äù began in some circles to be replaced by the term Hƒ™NAYƒÄNA (‚Äúlesser vehicle‚Äù), despite that term‚Äôs pejorative connotations. Perhaps in an effort to forestall this usage, PƒÅli scholars, including THOMAS W. RHYS DAVIDS (who often referred to PƒÅli Buddhism as ‚Äúoriginal Buddhism‚Äù), began referring to what had been known as ‚ÄúSouthern Buddhism‚Äù as TheravƒÅda. The term has since come to be adopted widely throughout Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.

&gt; Where are the rest of Pali schools?

Same source:

&gt; [...] to the extent that the TheravƒÅda is a remnant of the SthaviranikƒÅya, it represents just one of the several independent traditions of what many scholars now call MAINSTREAM BUDDHIST SCHOOLS [DHARMAGUPTA, MAHƒÄSƒÄ·πÇGHIKA, MAHƒ™≈öƒÄSAKA, SARVƒÄSTIVƒÄDA, SAUTRƒÄNTIKA, STHAVIRANIKƒÄYA, etc., which traditionally number eighteen].

&gt; If one teacher interprets this sutta is like this, how do we know that is actually similar to X Pali school?

Basically, that's not how it works. YogƒÅcƒÅra, Madhyamaka etc. originally were *schools of thought*, not schools as we understand the term today. ""Mainstream Buddhist Schools"" however were actually like that. The TheravƒÅda wasn't formed by absorption of or fusion with these schools or their core ideas. It in fact understands itself as being in opposition to those (see the remarks in the Dƒ´pava·πÉsa). Various schools of thought developed *inside* the TheravƒÅda instead, because the TheravƒÅda is actually a container like the MahƒÅyƒÅna is. And in the last two centuries the face of ""the TheravƒÅda"" changed greatly, notably by the quasi-elimination of its esoteric forms which used to be the mainstream. There are big regional differences, and within the various regions there are further ""schools"" [of thought?].

The sectarian line is that there's a monolith called the TheravƒÅda, but actually it's an entire jungle in its own right, like the MahƒÅyƒÅna. So in general you just have to look at the lineage of the person teaching a certain interpretation, and maybe try to see where it comes from.","This is not an answer to your questions really, and maybe someone more knowledgeable about the details of the history will answer, but perhaps [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/cfauct/a_bit_on_the_history_of_mahayana_in_theravada/) is nonetheless of some interest.","The term Theravada is actually very new, I think it comes from the late 1800s. Before that there was no singular name, it is perhaps the invention of Mahayana to name the traditions, in Theravada it was all about the lineage association.",,,,,,,,,,

131,,Buddhism,"Hey friends,

I hope you‚Äôre all doing well, much metta to all of you.

I am looking for a sutta (I think it‚Äôs from the Samyutta Nikaya).

It‚Äôs about the danger of clinging to the senses.

Essentially the sutta is talking about a king who befriends all his senses and they pretend to be his friends, so he‚Äôs happy with them and enjoys their company.

However when he died his attachment to the senses is what binds him to samsara.

The Buddha then said that the senses stabbed him in the back like thieves with a dagger, pretending to be his friend all along but inevitably betraying him.

If you have any ideas or know which sutta I am talking about, I‚Äôd really like to know which one it is :) 

I would like to share it with a friend of mine who‚Äôs still new and learning the basics about the danger of being attached to our desire related to the senses (which essentially all desire is I think? Not sure if there is desire beyond the senses apart from perhaps the desire for existence, non existence or nirvana but even those are mind objects initially aren‚Äôt they?).

I wish you all a wonderful day,

It seems for you that this could be a good place to start.","This Saturday (March 13 at 10:30am EST) on Zoom, there will be a dialogue between Guo Gu and Lorne Ladner, discussing the similarities between the practice of Mahamudra in the Tibetan tradition with the Chan practice of Silent Illumination.

139,,Buddhism,"There are people out there who tend to have a perennialist view, this is the idea that all religions have the same idea at their core. Or perhaps they might think that at least most Indian religions share the same core idea. Or maybe they might even just think that the ideas are different, but that doesn't matter since they all teach letting go and love and compassion, so why does it matter?

But the view does matter, why? Because it's directly related to clinging and also to how you practice.

This brings me to my show and tell piece for today. I was listening to a lecture on the philosophy of Ramanuja last night (I enjoy learning about other religions, since it helps me also understand my own perspective). The presenter got to a point which I think really captures the difference between Vedanta and Buddhadharma, and I want to share that because I think it's important.

Anyways, here's what they said (I'm going to paraphrase for space, but will post a link to the video below). The speaker was discussing how their guru had freely given away a beautiful and expensive ring they had and when he asked his guru why, the guru went on about how he was not attached to anything.

&gt;Guru: ""You think I need money? ....You think I need this? ....You think I'm attached to this person...that person? I'm not attached to that, I am not attached to this....""  
&gt;  
&gt;Disciple (Mayuran): Then I said to Guruji: ""You're attached to the soul yea?""  
&gt;  
&gt;Guru: ""Yes of course"" ... ""The soul I'm attached to""...  
&gt;  
&gt;Disciple: ""Guruji said this! 'I am attached to the soul' why? because ''atmeva'', the soul is my very Self, Guruji has come to reclaim what is his very Self.""

I think this says it all honestly. Vedanta lets go of everything...except the atman, except God. But in the Buddhadharma, we don't accept these ideas, not only that, but we hold that attachment to these \[false\] ideas leads to suffering.

Anyways, here is [the video I was watching](https://youtu.be/wCbv5UlgC0M), it's fascinating and you get to learn a bit about Vedanta's worldview. The story I mentioned starts at 55 minutes.

Another point in the video (at around one hour and 33 minutes) which also shows the radical different perspective in Vedanta comes a bit later when the speaker was discussing suffering. Basically, he states that everything is a manifestation of God and thus everything that happens (even the suffering) is auspicious, glorious and the will of the lord (and lets remember, the Bhagavad Gita is about God convincing a warrior to fight in a war and kill his family). Basically, from a Buddhist POV, this is just a cop out, a ""just so"" story to try to explain away the [problem of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil), a serious problem for those theists who believe in a loving god.

Regarding how the view affects practice, towards the end of the video we get a bit of how this school of Vedanta sees the spiritual path. Basically, its all based on bhakti, devotion to god (through chanting and rituals and so on), with the goal of going to heaven (Vaikunta) and serving god there **forever**.

But Advaita is kind of an outlier among the other vedanta schools (like Ramanuja's Vishishta Advaita, which you are speaking about here), because all of them are based in bhakti and feature a God who is a separate entity (or both separate and not separate at the same time). In that case the difference is pretty clear. But Advaita understands God in a more abstract way and ultimately considers the individual soul to be indentical to it.","A good comparison that I've heard goes like this (though the person simplified between Buddhism and Hindusim):

&gt;Hinduism points to the root of human existence, while Buddhism points to the root of human experience.

Of course, Hindus have a practice and Buddhists have cosmology/philosophy, but the nature of the core of their doctrines are different.","I don‚Äôt really think followers of Sri Vaishnavism are trying to syncretize Buddhism with their faith,  especially considering the view of the Buddha in Vaishnava traditions.

The re-aggregation of the fetters constructs the experience of a new realm of existence based upon karmic conditioning of how the Mind interprets reality, when the old fetters fall away. It is a continual process of becoming, moment to moment and life to life. If the causes of karmic conditioning and mental imputation are not extinguished, then the experience of a self and reality will continually be reconstructed and renewed. 

Think of it like desertification versus forestation. Desertification occurs when the ‚Äúfuel‚Äù of natural processes is interrupted‚Äîgrazing animals disappearing, for instance, which means no fertilizer and no clearing away of older brush, preventing newer brush from receiving enough nutrients. Over time, the plants crowd, over-compete, and then dry out the land. But if there are grazing animals migrating through, they introduce enough stress and fresh nutrients that the ecosystem naturally restores itself, and allows for continued growth. 

In this sense, the aggregation of the fetters and the construction of a mind-made reality experiencing self and other is the natural process that occurs when karmic fires are sustained. When they are extinguished, the process that constructs experiential reality is halted, and the remainder of that process is allowed to die out into extinction. But if the fuel is consistently added to and sustained, then even when one log of ‚Äúfirewood‚Äù burns up (death), another log is added and it continues on. 

It is this delusional process of re-becoming that is perpetuated through the process of clinging, and does not require any essential self to promulgate through time.","The appropriate term would be rebirth, as in we are reborn. The **only** way this is possible is if there is no soul. If there was a soul, you would always be that, the soul. Because there is no soul, we are able to change and become different things. You were once a baby, now you're an adult. This was all due to your karma, and this process will continue after death as the causes have not been severed.","This is often misunderstood. The ego does not reincarnate  (the self) the counciousness however, does. You are not your ego. You are not your thoughts, feelings, memories, personality, or preferences, or desires. You are not these things because as you are born grow and die, these things change with time and are in a constant state of change. Therefore if you base your concept of who you are on these things then you truly have nothing as they are in constant change and will be forever. All things must pass, even the stars die. If you isolate any one of these things which together is the ego, then it is just that. A thought or a feeling or a preference, or a memory or a belief etc. These items together form together to make the ego. The same ego which propagates selfishness and frivolous affairs, tribalism, rape, killing and so on. When we meditate with sufficient skill we can observe that the ego is not truly who we are, and yet without one who are we? For if we did not have one truly we would not be able to survive on earth and therefore the ego is nessecary for earthly life. What reincarnates is your raw conciousness, the observer. You are like a flame. If i put you out, and reignite you are you the same flame? Therefore this life is the only one YOU will get, but not completly.

It's pretty well-known that ""Hinayana"" is generally an exonym rather than something people call themselves, but that's kind of irrelevant to Mahayana claims of superiority.

Also, the term ""Hinayana"" is indeed used to identify specific groups. The Indian commentaries generally gloss the Hinayana as referring to the shravakayana and the pratyekabuddhayana, and those in turn are frequently identified with real-world groups such as the Vaibhashika and the Sautrantika. These identifications can be quite specific, naming the number of patches used on the robes of different orders (it's usually an odd number between 7 and 21, depending on tbe sect), as well as the specific practices and geographic locations of those sects.

It's unfortunate that Analayo published this, because now people who are ignorant about actual Mahayana polemics will think that they're justified in believing that the Hinayana is just a fairy tale. But, they're not. This is not a topic that Bhikkhu Analayo specializes in, and I think this essay is simply misleading.","&gt;the referent of the term ‚ÄúHinayana,‚Äù when it occurs in Buddhist texts themselves, is never any existent institution or organization, but a rhetorical fiction‚Ä¶ a fundamental error is thus made when we imagine references to ‚ÄúHinayana‚Äù in Mahayana literature to apply to so-called Sectarian Buddhism, much less to Early Buddhism.

and

&gt;There was never, during any period of Indian history, anywhere or at any time, any body of people or any social group‚Äîany sect, any faction, any monastic order, or any lay community‚Äîwhich identified itself as ‚ÄúHinayana.‚Äù The Hinayana never existed, anywhere or at any time, as an establishment or organization, as a social movement, as a self-conscious historical agent. Nor was Hinayana a stage or period in the development of Buddhism. What, then, was the referent of the term? What was its societal reality? Its referent was a body of ideas, not a social body. The Hinayanist was defined by Mahayanist polemics; he was a dogmatic construction, not a social identity.

This, I think, is generally the perspective I have tried to express when I have discussed this term before. 

The basic idea being that the 'great aspiration', one might say, is to free all beings from samsara. A 'lesser aspiration' is to basically forsake beings and be concerned with only one's own welfare.

From a Mahayana point of view, there is a use in delineating these two, for various layers of reasons.

I personally, basically, think it is wholly inappropriate to categorically apply the term to a tradition, as generally speaking we do not have clairvoyance enough to know the minds of all of the individuals within the tradition and fully know their thoughts/etc.

It may be that one can divide, from a Mahayana point of view, the scriptures into various turnings, like the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd turnings, and one might say for example that the Pali Canon relates to the 1st turning but does not explicitly, strongly contain the other 2 turnings (although aspects are there). But this is not the same thing as saying, ""Theravadins are Hinayana practitioners.""

First, you are very fortunate to have discovered the path at such a young age. Keep it up. But I also encourage you to be patient. It can be a long path, and more of a marathon than a sprint.

The process of learning about the fundamentals is very valuable. Generally, once you've learned them, the next step, in my opinion, is to connect to a living tradition. Find the chance to visit living practitioners. If you are studying Theravada, for me, the Thai Forest Tradition are the gold standard of Theravada Sangha. I had the good fortune to meet one of them in person. It was life changing.

Meeting real Dharma teachers in person is something that will change the course of your spiritual journey. It is an important next step. Connecting to Arya is something that has no substitute.

As one other point, I was totally fixated on stream entry - understanding what it is, how to get there, what it takes to get there. These are answers that can be found. The Thai Forest monks can tell you exactly what stream entry is and what it takes to get there. However - it takes a lot. It takes an amount that I wasn't sure was possible while living as a married layperson working a job in the city. I was very close to leaving my wife in order to pursue the path of renunciation because I thought that this is the only way.

I discovered that there are traditions - powerful traditions - that can take us to great heights to attainment but do not require the same degree of renunciation. Now, of course, this transition is not necessary or helpful for every person. But it was necessary and helpful for me. I now generally consider it to be good advice for people, once they understand the Savaka path, to look around into the other paths and see if any karmic tendrils there catch them. They may not, at least, not yet. But, when I did  this, important doors opened.

The final point I will say is not to discount the importance of merit. Merit is of supreme importance. If you are stuck in the lay life - and unable to practice supreme renunciation - make sure that you are thinking carefully about how you are creating merit and towards what goal you are dedicating that merit, because this is really important.","You need to pick a school. Then you need to talk to that school's monk/guru/lama. You follow that monk's curriculum, program, suggestion, advice, rather than self-architecting your path.","In reality this is a difficult question, no one actually knows if this is good progression because....no one is on your path....no need to compare yourself or even think about if you have made good progress..both will only result in ego boost....

But I will ""warn"",

When I started 6 years ago, I thought I knew it all after the first year, everything seemed great...felt like I really had control of myself...I read Sutras, could recite ALOT of them, could go into great detail about the eightfold path....in retrospect, my naiveness was a joke...I didn't know sh\*t...

In a no biased perspective I was naively Pseudo enlightened and I have met many people who have experienced this when they start out....stuff clearly started coming apart in year 2-3 in which I might as well been a common guy who just knew buddhism...Year 4 is when I would say I started to truly ""get it"" and how it is supposed to be approached..

Good Luck!,"Most of the questions you are listing are irrelevant in the Buddhist practice.
In Buddhism there‚Äôs not a creation of the universe.

There‚Äôs no god that created anything. Things just arise and cease naturally.

Humans are just beings that have the intellect to practice the dhamma differently from other animals. It‚Äôs very good to be born as a human.

To sum up Buddhism for you the Buddha thought suffering and the path leading to its cessation. This is Buddhism. It‚Äôs very different from the common definition of a religion.

Having said that, we do have devas and realms and ghosts and so on. These things were mentioned by the Buddha. But ultimately they are irrelevant for the practice. For instance devas are like gods, but they are not eternal, can‚Äôt actually help you much on the practice since they are themselves in Samsara. The human has to walk the path himself and get to know things by himself.

About the purpose of life. As you expect if there was no creator god setting purposes, things just are, no actual purpose to them. There are skillful and unskillful ways to live. But doesn‚Äôt mean that for instance to realize Nibbana is the purpose of life. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs something you can do with it if you decide.

It‚Äôs like water, what is the purpose of water? Is it for the fish to swim? Is it it for animals to drink? Is it to make life possible? 
It‚Äôs not right? Water just is. Has no set in stone purpose on itself. Then things interact with water and other things happen.

https://www.dhammatalks.org is a good place to visit to get information. But keep in mind that you will find that it‚Äôs very practice oriented. Meditation and virtue and so on, like I said the answers you are looking for are not the things a Buddhist thinks about.",,,,,,,,,,

The Pali Canon is composed of three (ti) baskets (pi·π≠aka): suttapitaka (collections of sermons by the Buddha and close disciples), vinayapitaka (monastic rules), and abhidhammapitaka (abstracted and systematized formulations of the teachings).

You will likely find what is contained in the suttapitaka to be most interesting and relevant to you. The suttapitaka is divided into five nikayas: Dƒ´ghanikƒÅya (long suttas), MajjhimanikƒÅya (middle length suttas), Sa·πÅyuttanikƒÅya (thematically connected suttas), A·πÖguttaranikƒÅya (numerically orginized suttas), KhuddakanikƒÅya (miscellaneous collection). The MajjhimanikƒÅya is probably the most accessible of the nikayas, because it provides the teachings in a largely narrative manner.

www.dhammatalks.org provides large anthologies of each nikaya for free in electronic or physical form. There are also very useful study guides that provide collections of suttas on specific topics available on dhammatalks.org

Wisdom Publications has full translations for the first for nikayas for sale as physical or electronic books.","It's incredibly long, which is why you'll find many anthologies. The Tipitaka, spelled specifically that way, *is* the Pali canon. The other canons are spelled 'Tripitaka', and I think the Tibetan canon has a different classification schema in general.

Since you're specifically looking for the Pali Tipitaka, yes, there are many different versions maintained by many different traditions, but that's sort of an aside as there are only minor grammatical differerences here and there. But also yes, the Tipitaka is composed of *many* different volumes of texts. If you want to buy the entire thing, you'll need to buy a number of very specific texts, and be careful to avoid any of the anthologies.

You will need to purchase separately the five Nikayas of the Pali Sutta-pitaka:

* Digha Nikaya
* Majjhima Nikaya
* Samyutta Nikaya
* Anguttara Nikaya
* Khudakka Nikaya

You will need the Pali Vinaya, which itself might be published in 3-5 or more volumes, depending on edition.

You will also need the Pali Abhidhamma, which itself is split up into seven books, and I am not sure how any English translation might split those books up into volumes.","A lot of people don‚Äôt grasp how large the Pali Canon (to say nothing of the Chinese Canon, which is even larger). It‚Äôs not like the Bible. As far as the Pali Canon goes, I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any reason for lay people to be interested in anything beyond the Nikayas.",,,,,,,,,,

Basically. Samsaric existence, you might say, which depending on how you understand it is 'existence' as a whole. Which is not to praise something that is called 'non-existence' as a state of being either.

In general, I think it's not entirely unreasonable to say that with awakening, the root of 'the mind' is cut, and the 'nature of mind' is realized. Existence relates to the mind. If one gets a taste of the 'nature of mind', which is sort of free from the notions of existence and non-existence and the rest, then it is realized that all existence related to the mind is inherently stressful, basically. And so one is naturally oriented towards overcoming samsaric existence as a whole, basically.

FWIW. All the best.","It might be helpful to understand the scope of [Dukkha](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn45/sn45.165.wlsh.html) and how it is explained:

""Monks, there are these three kinds of suffering.\[1\] What three? Suffering caused by pain,\[2\] suffering caused by the formations (or conditioned existence),\[3\] suffering due to change.\[4\] It is for the full comprehension, clear understanding, ending and abandonment of these three forms of suffering that the Noble Eightfold Path is to be cultivated...""

‚Äî SN 45.165

1. Dukkhataa, an abstract noun denoting ""suffering"" in the most general sense.
2. Dukkha-dukkhataa, the actual feeling of physical or mental pain or anguish.
3. Sankhaara-dukkhataa, the suffering produced by all ""conditioned phenomena"" (i.e., sankhaaras, in the most general sense: see BD \[Buddhist Dictionary (2nd ed.), by Ven. Nyaa.natiloka, Ven. Nyaa.naponika (ed.), Colombo 1972\] s.v. sankhaara I, 4). This includes also experiences associated with hedonically neutral feeling. The suffering inherent in the formations has its roots in the imperfectability of all conditioned existence, and in the fact that there cannot be any final satisfaction within the incessant turning of the Wheel of Life. The neutral feeling associated with this type of suffering is especially the indifference of those who do not understand the fact of suffering and are not moved by it.
4. Viparinaama-dukkhataa, the suffering associated with pleasant bodily and mental feelings: ""because they are the cause for the arising of pain when they change"" (VM XIV, 35).

This means that all conditioned phenomena are Dukkha, which means that only Nibbana is not marked by Dukkha.

This Sutta is extremely straight-forward about the scope of the problem. As understanding grows of this, [samvega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sa%E1%B9%83vega) may develop.","&gt;'Just as even a trifling amount of feces is foul smelling, I do not praise even a trifling amount of existence‚Äô

&gt;Whats wrong with existence?


Nothing is wrong with it, but even a finger-snap of existence is marked by impermanence, no-self, and suffering. 

Ignorance about this leads to grasping &amp; attachment to existence, to life, to self, which in the end only results in suffering.

Seeing the emptiness of existence, ""not praising even a trifling amount of existence"", leads to unbinding from the grasping &amp; attachment to existence, to life, to self, which ultimately results in nirvana.",,,,,,,,,,
154,,Buddhism,"Hello community! First post here but I lurk and listen haha. 

So recently I've been contemplating the three marks. I find much wisdom in those three little statements, it feels like the real heart of the matter for me. 

That all conditioned things are always changing and thus cannot satisfy, make perfect sense and resonates with my experience of the world around me, including my body, mind, thoughts etc. So I'm good with those 2 marks. 

Where I think we possibly go wrong is in the interpretation of Anatta. I often hear it said that Buddha meant there is no abiding self or soul in conditioned things. But having read many Suttas, Buddha was quite insistent on remaining silent when asked questions about God, Soul and metaphysical things in general. So why make such a bold claim in the three marks...? I'm not sure Buddha meant that. 

What feels more accurate to me is that Buddha was pointing out that nothing conditioned is truly of yourself, i.e. you don't and cannot in reality ""possess"" anything, including this body and mind, other people, or any object. This reflects my experience where we seem to assume ownership of things, only to be rudely reminded we don't anything actually, especially when it comes to relationships, and that the healthiest form of relationship is grounded in non possessiveness. 

If he truly meant no self at all exists, who or what reincarnates? Who or what underlies and experiences the world, including my ever changing bundle of thoughts that comprise ""who I am"" at any given moment? I just can't get down with this idea it feels like it doesn't fit somehow.

No, this is not true. Read those texts again.

There are only *some* things he was silent on. One is whether or not the universe has a beginning--this is the one where people think he is silent on the topic of God, but he's not talking about God at all. He's just talking about whether or not there is a beginning to the universe.

On the topic of God, in the Brahmajala Sutta, he is *absolutely* rejecting that concept. He was not silent on this matter.

On the topic of the ""soul,"" you are thinking of where he refuses to answer if a *Tathagata* exists or doesn't exist after death, which is an invalid question because such concepts do not apply to extinguished Buddhas. 

But on the actual topic of self or soul, he was actually quite firm in rejecting that anything can be called self (and this is actually found explicit and literally in the first noble truth).","Is there anything anywhere in the world -  conditioned or unconditioned - where you would say ""this is me, this is myself, this is who I am?""",The Buddha was on silent on questions with invalid invalid premises such as ‚ÄúHow was the self in the past‚Äù since it falsely presumed the existence of a self. He taught a lot of metaphysics just things like ‚ÄúAll formations are impermanent‚Äù or Dependent origination are metaphysics.,,,,,,,,,,

The section after he leaves Ramaputra and where he should encounter the milk maid omits that event:

&gt; ""In search of what might be skillful, seeking the unexcelled state of sublime peace, I wandered by stages in the Magadhan country and came to the military town of Uruvela. There I saw some delightful countryside, with an inspiring forest grove, a clear-flowing river with fine, delightful banks, and villages for alms-going on all sides.

This is just right for the exertion of a clansman intent on exertion.' So I sat down right there, thinking, 'This is just right for exertion.'

The Canon tends to describe the event which surrounds the giving of the sermon, not really the things before that event ( by a long shot ) or long afterwards. So for example in the Brahmajalla we know that this sermons was given when the Buddha heard monks yabbering with each other and decided to give a talk.

&gt;Then the Venerable Ananda said: [""But how, Lord, should they act respecting the body of the Tathagata?""](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html)

&gt;""After the same manner, Ananda, as towards the body of a universal monarch.""

&gt;""But how, Lord, do they act respecting the body of a universal monarch?""

&gt;""The body of a universal monarch, Ananda, is first wrapped round with new linen, and then with teased cotton wool, and so it is done up to five hundred layers of linen and five hundred of cotton wool. When that is done, the body of the universal monarch is placed in an iron oil vessel, which is enclosed in another iron vessel, a funeral pyre is built of all kinds of perfumed woods, and so the body of the universal monarch is burned; and at a crossroads a stupa is raised for the universal monarch. So it is done, Ananda, with the body of a universal monarch. And even, Ananda, as with the body of a universal monarch, so should it be done with the body of the Tathagata; and at a crossroads also a stupa should be raised for the Tathagata. And whosoever shall bring to that place garlands or incense or sandalpaste, or pay reverence, and whose mind becomes calm there ‚Äî it will be to his well being and happiness for a long time.

&gt;""There are four persons, Ananda, who are worthy of a stupa. Who are those four? A Tathagata, an Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One is worthy of a stupa; so also is a Paccekabuddha, and a disciple of a Tathagata, and a universal monarch.

&gt;""And why, Ananda, is a Tathagata, an Arahant, a Fully Enlightened One worthy of a stupa? Because, Ananda, at the thought: 'This is the stupa of that Blessed One, Arahant, Fully Enlightened One!' the hearts of many people will be calmed and made happy; and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness. And so also at the thought: 'This is the stupa of that Paccekabuddha!' or 'This is the stupa of a disciple of that Tathagata, Arahant, Fully Enlightened One!' or 'This is the stupa of that righteous monarch who ruled according to Dhamma!' ‚Äî the hearts of many people are calmed and made happy; and so calmed and with their minds established in faith therein, at the breaking up of the body, after death, they will be reborn in a realm of heavenly happiness. And it is because of this, Ananda, that these four persons are worthy of a stupa.""

For your average dead person, people can donate to monastics for their benefit in the event that their relative ends up in the hungry ghost realms (or for any other relatives there).","We hold funerals. In the Vietnamese tradition, it‚Äôs three days of rituals before the burial/cremation. Lots of chanting and prostrations. 

49 days later, we hold the 49 day ceremony.

I‚Äôm not going to type out the whole process because it‚Äôs very involved, but if you need to learn it, a funeral director should have contact info for a temple that can provide such services.

The fact that they don't recognize themselves in the mirror (which is basically what those ""self-awareness experiments"" actually are about) illustrates one of the central factors in their suffering: animals, with very few exceptions, are *stupid*. In the literal sense: they are unable to conceptualize anything outside their given frame of reference. Mirrors are too complicated *conceptually* for all but a few animals. 

But look at little birds for example. See how they're constantly on the lookout for dangers. The slightest unexpected movement can rile up while flocks. When we talk about self-clinging in the context of dharma we're not talking about something philosophical, or even psychological, eeally. We're talking about the root of that powerful fear.

Just some thoughts.",Animals have self-awareness. They wouldn‚Äôt mark their territories with urine if they didn‚Äôt know what their own scent smelled like.

His ideas don't necessarily reflect Buddhist teachings (even if he says differently). In that sense, this might not be the right sub to ask. 

That said, Buddhism teaches *anatman*, translated as non-self or no-self, selflessness and so on. 

Let's take a river as an example. Suppose you dig up the river banks, relocate the fish and the ducks, tell people to take their boats home, dam and reroute the water, bulldoze the river bed and so on... Would you somehow still have ""the river"" left?

No~~m~~, ""the river"" was just a label on a whole heap of ever changing phenomena. 

It's the same for us. There's various heaps of phenomena that we over the course of a day (and a life) identify with as ourselves, such as our physical bodies, our experiences, our thoughts, our consciousness and so on. Just like with the river though, we're actually not ""inside"" any of these heaps. Nor does any of that have a permanent identity. Our bodies, thoughts and all that are constantly changing, and without any fixed shape or Identity of their own. The Sanskrit word for these ""heaps"" is *skandhas* if you want to Google more info about it. 

Of course, none of this is random. One experience causes and conditions further experiences. The fundamental teaching of Buddhism is that all experiences arise due to *dependent origination*. In as much as as flawed and inconsistent an idea as a self or an ""ego"" needs an alternative, you could look into that. 

I haven't studied Watts at all, so I couldn't say what he meant exactly, but this is maybe a short, incomplete intro to some Buddhist teachings around this topic. For what it's worth.","You may want to ask over at /r/AlanWatts. Alan Watts is considered an eclectic philosopher who is not exactly Buddhist. However, Buddhism also says the same thing.

One way to frame this is that the ego is an illusion, along with all the problems it creates. When you perceive that this is so, the problems go away too. How you develop this understanding is by studying the explanations in Buddhism and applying it (in meditation, contemplation, etc.) 

There are other ways to frame the fundamental teachings of Buddhism. Some may be easier to understand than others.

You may want to read some Buddhist books as well. The sidebar/Wiki here has some suggestions.",Alan Watts did not teach Buddhism but the alternative to the illusion of self is enlightenment.,,,,,,,,,,
165,,Buddhism,"Hello,

I am a 28yo and for a while I have been considering ordination as I have done all I had to do in lay life. I am debt free, no kids, have a girlfriend that I live with for 7 years that understands my decision. My family as my mother, father and brother don‚Äôt need me, everyone is ok enough. So I am as free as one can be by choice and conditions, I decided to always be in the position where I could go out and live in the forest if I wanted, so I never bought a house, always rented, always took care to not have debts, never bought a car that I would have to sell and paperwork and so on to live behind. This way of life was always in me even not knowing Buddhism. So I was in a way inclined towards something like this for a while.

I have been practicing consistently enough in terms of meditation, also been keeping my precept with a few slip ups here and there but it‚Äôs good enough, mostly with psychedelics in search to help in my practice... I know it‚Äôs stupid and I have already made the decision it wouldn‚Äôt take me anywhere so I might have stopped with that for good. As life is uncertain and I don‚Äôt know how long I have left I think I shouldn‚Äôt postpone it much longer than I have already did.

I have a monastery in my country from the Theravada forest tradition of the lineage of Ajahn Chah. It‚Äôs called Sumedharama in Portugal and is growing fast enough already with several kutis, a big meditation hall and so on, the area is pretty big too and a beautiful and calm place 1:30h by transport from where I live.

Still, I came to know recently on a Zoom dhamma talk that by wanting to ordain there the person would only find ‚Äúfrustration‚Äù using the words of one of the Ajahns. This because there are basically no rooms left and if someone wants to ordain he would better move abroad.

The nearest possible places to stay as a lay guest and eventually ordain are Amaravati or Chithurst, I want go go forth on Ajahn Chah lineage so I am ignoring any other monasteries that aren‚Äôt part of this lineage.

But now with Brexit I don‚Äôt know how it will be for European people to move to England just to become a monk. I know for short stays we can still go there even without a visa, the European Citizen Cart still serves the purpose it used to. But I don‚Äôt know about being as easy as before to move there.

Also in terms of rooms. I know Amaravati at least has already a big Sangha and therefore lives me wandering if they are not in the same situation as Sumedharama in terms of rooms... 

As a last resource I would go to Wat Pah Nanachat in Thailand but this would make the process more complicated monetarily speaking as I would have to go there stay as a guest and then probably comeback here. It‚Äôs far away and expensive. Then comeback again and stay or come back depending on their decision and in this would be a lot of money. I intend to leave behind as much as I can with people close to me so spending in flights back and forth is not optimal. Even though by my way of life money is not a big problem to do it in a optimal way would be good. Specially not spending 3 months rent per trip that I could live behind for my girlfriend to help to not feel a sudden crash in quality of life as I go.

I would send them an email directly and will eventually about my questions but they are now in winter retreat so a reply would be postponed until it‚Äôs over. So if anyone here is in a similar situation and has already got some answers about the subject of ordaining in these places I would appreciate it.

In the Tibetan traditions I practice in, for better it worse, you're rarely sitting down with a Sutra and studying it directly. In that sense they're not that important. On the other hand, the commentaries that explain the oral tradition that is at the heart of our practices constantly refer to the Sutras and Tantras. In that sense they're the foundation of everything we do. Classically, in the Tibetan tradition ""a temple"" was pretty much defined by having the Canon present on the shrine.

176,,Buddhism,"Being a Buddhist does not mean that you must be quiet or look solemn. If friends try to get you to go in a way which is unwholesome and you are observing the moral precepts, you should not follow them. You might lose your friends but you will not lose yourself. If you are satisfied that you have gone the way of wholesomeness, you should consider the Buddha as an example. He was a prince who had a large retinue and many friends. He renounced the world, gave up those friends, and went to dwell alone for many years. After he had attained Enlightenment, he was surrounded by friends and had many disciples who were Arahants (Pure Ones), monks as well as nuns, lay men and lay women, until the number of Buddhists was more than the population of the world. 

We all believe in the teachings of the Buddha, which unites the hearts and minds of all Buddhists. We therefore should not be afraid of having no friends. We should think, first of all, that our friends do not yet understand us, and so they drift away and no longer associate with us. Our way of practice in the way of wholesomeness still remains, however. We should see that there are still good people in the world!

Good people eventually meet and become friends with other good people, and these good people will be our friends. If there are no good people in the world, and if there is nobody interested in associating with us, then we should associate with the Dhamma in our hearts, which is better than friends who are not interested in goodness at all. 

Ordinarily, those good friends of yours will come back to you. You should therefore rest assured that if your heart is satisfied that you are going in a wholesome direction, then that is enough. You should not be concerned with or worry about others more than yourself. You should be responsible for yourself in the present and in the future, for there is nobody but yourself who can raise you up to a higher level.

Mathematically that's not possible.","After experiencing extreme physical and emotional  trauma and much physical loss (wealth and good health)  I lost all of my friends except 3 (one being my mother, the other a lover)  

Before this trauma I was fairly popular 

As I've regained my good physical and mental health, I'm also welcomed into my old friends.  

And I really have lost my desire to be with them. 

Although I've experienced brain damage limiting my ability to socialize, and have recently regained that ability.  

I looked back so resentfully when I was sick, that I could not socialize with my friends.  I thought it would be the greatest hurtle to communicate with and share joy again.  

But once healed I look back, I think

When those were my friends, we gossiped, we drank wine, we ignored our duties, we hurt our selves and others through our gossip.   

It hurts, but I no longer desire to see them.  This post brought me great peace and reassurance.   Thankyou",,,,,,,,,,

Existence is not easy. But ultimately, existing in great suffering is less effort than killing yourself. If you try it out, you'll see it's a lot easier--you don't even have to do anything. Stop eating for a few days--you're still existing. lay in bed for two weeks--still existing.

The only reasonable choice, then, is practice. If even to make the tiniest and most incremental progress. Practice. The *worst* that could possibly happen is dying without making progress, and you're still where you are. But you're here already, no? Nothing has been lost in that attempt. And you're not afraid of dying.

Non-existence would be so much sweeter, but that's not possible, is it? So the best thing you could possibly do is just practice until you die. Take the gamble and place your bets on the dharma. If you conquer the mind, that's absolutely wonderful. If you don't, and die in the process, you'll have at least made some incremental progress.

If everything in existence is suffering, what's the harm in just focusing on the practice, and reasoning if nothing works out, you'll die in that effort? It seems like it has a better chance of escaping suffering than just killing yourself.

I won't promise you it'll get better, because I don't know that. But what I can tell you is that a lot of people here have been where you are before. I myself still don't care if I die. I no longer am eagerly awaiting it, but I've nothing that really keeps me clinging to existence either. And indifference is quite beautiful--I can put in the work, because what else am I going to do? And if something crappy happens to me or my life, I'll die *eventually* anyway, so might as well coast on this wave of existence until it's over, and see how far I can get along the way.

So that is my weird bit of unconventional advice to you: you can always die tomorrow; and since you can always die tomorrow, that's a good reason to put in the practice today, *in case* it ends up making a significant difference.","FWIW - https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/ak7nhq/dilgo_khyentse_rinpoche_on_the_gradual_dharma/

In general, part of Buddhism says that craving leads to suffering. Craving for non-existence is actually still craving.

I would suggest that you first and foremost get formal medical help if you are suicidal/depressed. I personally am a physician, and I work with depression regularly.

I think in general, it's not entirely unfair to say that depression is sort of like a form of psychic blindness in which one can see nothing beyond one's own current mind.

But over, and over, and over again, people do get through their depression, even if they see no way out at a certain point or points, even if they get to the brink of suicide, etc. And over, and over, and over again people are happy that they didn't take that step of killing themselves, even though it certainly seemed to have an appeal while they were in the midst of their storm.

Also, FWIW, the Buddha says in the Kusala Sutta,

&gt;""Develop what is skillful, monks. It is possible to develop what is skillful. If it were not possible to develop what is skillful, I would not say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' But because it is possible to develop what is skillful, I say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' If this development of what is skillful were conducive to harm and pain, I would not say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.' But because this development of what is skillful is conducive to benefit and pleasure, I say to you, 'Develop what is skillful.'""

I'm confident you can connect more fully with virtue, the path.

I hope that you, in time anyway, come to see that too.

All the best. FWIW.","Karma doesn't necessarily have to be fair, it just is cause and effect basically.

The desire for suicide generally arises out of a craving for non-existence.  That kind of craving plants negative seeds in your mindstream that can actually lead to a rebirth in an even less fortunate environment.

Killing yourself might seem like a good idea, but it'll actually just make your problems worse, potentially significantly worse.

And if you're reborn into a lower realm like the animal realm for example, that makes it much more difficult to do things like accumulate positive merit in order to get a fortunate rebirth again.  You might have to go through countless lifetimes of suffering just to be able to be reborn as a human again.

So please, don't kill yourself.  It's really not worth it.",,,,,,,,,,

182,,Buddhism,"hi everyone - 

I have been a practicing Buddhist for quite some years, but over the last few years have become more and more serious about my personal practice and connection to the teachings. This has been a wonderful thing, but has brought many changes. 

I recently moved to a new location and now have many cardboard boxes full of gear for one of my favorite hobbies - aquarium and exotic insect keeping and breeding.  I've been doing this for nearly 40 years and get great enjoyment out of the beauty of these small creatures. I have been successful in growing rare freshwater plants, breeding interesting breeds of fish of all types, and raising and breeding insects such as phasmids, mantids, ants and more.  

I'm good at it and have always shared a lot of info with the aquatic and insect community,  gotten young people into the hobby, and given away (never sold) many, many breeds to aspiring keepers over the years.  Many people come to admire my setups and get started with me, and I enjoy helping other people see the incredible beauty of these animals. 

Suddenly I am feeling sensitive to the captivity of these organisms, which is mainly for the enjoyment of myself and others. I know that many of these insects and fish would never have survived in the wild and I am confident that I provide them with good conditions and diet they wouldn't find outside.  For the insects, and sometimes the fish, I keep breeder tanks where small fish, snails, worms, and flies are bred to be feeders to the other creatures. Again, I know that these creates have to eat anyways and would be eating those things in the wild, but I think it about a lot suddenly.

I've spent much of my lifetime in this hobby, so it hurts a bit to leave it. But, I can make peace with that. Unfortunately, I am just not sure if it really matters. I do believe deeply that all these creatures, even the feeders, are living under fantastic conditions that I labor over and maintain. But, I wonder what karma and energy I am giving and receiving with this whole activity. 

So, the cardboard boxes are just stacked up for now. I might give it all away, but it's such a rich and beautiful thing I also think I should get back into it, and keep sharing it with others. 

I would be interested in any perspectives on this and especially any teachings or references. I understand that to many this might be seen as 'overthinking it' but I am looking at this stack of boxed equipment and have decided that I'm going to really consider this deeply.

&lt;p&gt;Suddenly I am feeling sensitive to the captivity of these organisms, which is mainly for the enjoyment of myself and others. I know that many of these insects and fish would never have survived in the wild and I am confident that I provide them with good conditions and diet they wouldn&amp;#39;t find outside.  For the insects, and sometimes the fish, I keep breeder tanks where small fish, snails, worms, and flies are bred to be feeders to the other creatures. Again, I know that these creates have to eat anyways and would be eating those things in the wild, but I think it about a lot suddenly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve spent much of my lifetime in this hobby, so it hurts a bit to leave it. But, I can make peace with that. Unfortunately, I am just not sure if it really matters. I do believe deeply that all these creatures, even the feeders, are living under fantastic conditions that I labor over and maintain. But, I wonder what karma and energy I am giving and receiving with this whole activity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, the cardboard boxes are just stacked up for now. I might give it all away, but it&amp;#39;s such a rich and beautiful thing I also think I should get back into it, and keep sharing it with others. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would be interested in any perspectives on this and especially any teachings or references. I understand that to many this might be seen as &amp;#39;overthinking it&amp;#39; but I am looking at this stack of boxed equipment and have decided that I&amp;#39;m going to really consider this deeply. &lt;/p&gt;

183,,Buddhism,"Today in my Buddhist Philosophy class we began discussing DignƒÅga's *Autocommentary to the Investigation of the Percept*, and I have to say, this is just a genius essay of his.

DignƒÅga begins by stating that the object of perception must be both the cause of our perceiving it and must actually phenomenally match up with our perceptual experience. He doesn't give arguments for these, but frankly I think they are fairly uncontroversial. I think you could make the following two arguments on this. The first condition must hold to explain the regularity of perceiving specific things: if there was no causal connection between the object perceived and the perception of that object, we would have no explanation for why I only perceive a given object in one given situation and not another. The second condition seems to hold almost tautologically. If I perceive something red but the actual object in front of me is blue, obviously I'm not perceiving the blue thing, so it isn't the object of my perception. A person who is really drunk might see double when really there is just one thing, and that would be a mistaken perception: they wouldn't actually be perceiving the object in front of them properly.

DignƒÅga then takes for granted a standard physical theory of the day: philosophical atomism, the view that all objects are either imperceptible partless particles or made of such particles.

Now what is DignƒÅga's actual argument? He argues that no object which is external and separate from the actual cognition, *perception*, can be the object of perception. Atoms themselves cannot themselves be perceived, because they are imperceptible. Thus, they can't satisfy the second of the two conditions for something to be an object of perception. However, those supposedly perceivable objects, *collections* of atoms, can't satisfy the *first* condition. Why is this the case?

The reason why the collection cannot satisfy the causal condition is that the causal explanation is already satisfied by the atoms themselves. The atoms interacting in such as way as to cause perception (e.g. with light and our eyes, or however they believed perception worked at that time, I'm not sure) is a *sufficient cause for perception*. So the whole collection of atoms cannot play any additional role in causing the perception, and thus the collection (which is the thing that supposedly meets the second condition) can't meet the first condition, that the object of perception be the cause of perception.

Thus, no external object can meet the criteria for being a percept, and the real percept must be something entirely internal, refuting both direct realism and the representationalism of earlier SautrƒÅntika philosophers. By the representationalism of earlier SautrƒÅntika philosophers, I refer to the view that the object of perception is a mental object that is caused by an external object and has properties that are all ""representations"" of the real properties of the external object. In other words, it acknowledges that perception doesn't actually involve the mind somehow reaching out and accessing something external to itself, but nevertheless holds that perceptions are actually of some external thing, because an external thing causes the perception and the phenomenal content of the perception *accurately represents* the external thing.

DignƒÅga's argument in this essay refutes both representationalism and direct realism, something I didn't realize the first time this text was taught to me. When I first read it, I saw it as just a refutation of direct realism, but now I see that it actually leaves only two possibilities: either perception is caused by external objects but tells us literally nothing about said objects (because they cannot feature in perceptual contents), or perception is entirely unrelated to external objects altogether (a view which I think might lend itself to the position taken by YogƒÅcƒÅra Buddhists, i.e. that perceptions are actually caused by the ripening of impressions in the subconscious mind).

First, note the similarity between DignƒÅga's causal exclusion argument here and [recent arguments in philosophy of mind that also rely on causal exclusion](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/mental-causation/#ProIIIExc), but are aimed at arguing for *physicalism*. These arguments point out a problem for some someone who wants to argue that states of mind are non-physical properties that just happen to be inevitably possessed by certain living things by virtue of them possessing certain kinds of physical properties, like ""having a certain brain state."" The problem is that it would seem that the physical properties would be a sufficient cause for anything we would want to say the mental state causes, so the mental state has no causal work left to do and thus it is unclear why we would posit it as having causal efficacy. But note that DignƒÅga's causal exclusion argument for the internality of percepts actually might serve to *refute* physicalism, via an argument made by Jan Westerhoff in articles such as *What it Means to Live in a Virtual World Generated by Our Brain*: if we don't think our perceptions are of external objects, we no longer have particular reasons to trust neuroscientific claims about physical states co-occuring with certain mental states, since all of those claims are based on perceptions of brains. Thus, DignƒÅga's argument possibly opens the door for ""irrealism"" (to use Westerhoff's term) about the very scientific facts that make physicalist metaphysics appealing.

Second, note that DignƒÅga's argument here doesn't actually rely on philosophical atomism. So long as the things which feature in our perceptions are things we would want to say are sufficiently explicable via some events concerning imperceptible objects, be they electrons, quarks, whatever, the argument still holds. The imperceptible stuff will be what we want to call a sufficient cause for the appearance of our perceptions, meaning the actual things featuring in our perceptions will always be causally excluded.

I hope this brief summary of DignƒÅga's essay is interesting to people here. I doubt I've understood the full nuances of the essay and I may have made mistakes in explanation, so consider any faults of this post my own and not those of that Lord of Reasoning DignƒÅga. Also, I benefited greatly from reading /u/yahkopi's discussion of this essay in the comments of [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/izjqzy/dignagas_phenomenalism_and_the_impossibility_of/) post here when understanding the concepts in this essay, so check out that post for a cool discussion about different dimensions of DignƒÅga's arguments and their implications. Indeed, I don't actually think I would have understood the way in which this text both refutes direct realism and representationalism if I hadn't reread some of yahkopi's comments there.

Feel free to ignore them if you don't have time or take as much time as you need to answer. You've mentioned that in his essay *On Perception* (which I think is the first chapter of his *Collection of Essays*?), DignƒÅga actually rejects both of the two conditions for the object of perception that he mentions here. This raises three questions for me, as someone who has read this text (and has been taught it twice now, though the first time I don't think I understood it well) but has not read the *Collection*.

1. What is DignƒÅga's alternative account of perception? All I know is what I've heard in a John Dunne talk that I listened to but didn't understand well. In that talk, he says that DignƒÅga and Dharmakƒ´rti consider perception to be some kind of entirely non-conceptual awareness. What exactly does this mean, and how is it to be understood in the context of DignƒÅga's other views?

2. What is the philosophical motivation for DignƒÅga to propose this alternative account of perception in his later works?

3. Insofar as this particular essay functions seemingly as a mere *reductio*, is it true that DignƒÅga's later works don't render the argument presented here any less powerful? Or does DignƒÅga's later theory of ""non-conceptual perception"" somehow allow for a realist theory of perception that nevertheless avoids the challenges presented above?

Then I have one additional question. In the actual text, DignƒÅga doesn't seem to explicitly spell out the connection between the lack of causal efficacy of a collection of atoms and the sufficiency of the causal efficacy of the atoms themselves. That is, he doesn't seem to state this as a causal exclusion argument. He just says that collections can't be the cause of the arising of cognition because they aren't substantially real. Now, in Vinƒ´tadeva's *Subcommentary* to this essay, he seems to lean towards phrasing it in a more clear way, saying ""a collection is not a percept because it is not a cause,"" and also adding that ""in the case of collections, their representation is present, but causality is absent."" But even here, he doesn't go into the *reason* why a collection can't be a cause, i.e. because this would result in overdetermination since we think the things collected are already a sufficient cause. So since this causal exclusion argument isn't stated directly, how do we know this is the best interpretation of the text? I think it might be the most *successful* argument, but can we say for sure that it was what DignƒÅga intended?","&gt; now I see that it actually leaves only two possibilities: **either perception is caused by external objects but tells us literally nothing about said objects (because they cannot feature in perceptual contents)**, or perception is entirely unrelated to external objects altogether (a view which I think might lend itself to the position taken by YogƒÅcƒÅra Buddhists, i.e. that perceptions are actually caused by the ripening of impressions in the subconscious mind).

The bolded was always my first reading, although I've moving into the second view. At the same time, I've been considering the role of dialectical analysis within a Buddhist context, and I'm wondering if it isn't as cut-and-dry as this, and maybe I'm deconstructing a little bit of what it even means to be 'external.'

Just some initial thoughts, may have more later.","This is a fantastic summary of Dignaga's essay. I first heard about Dignaga on the History of Philosophy podcast and I was completely taken aback by how he was able to both succinctly and clearly demonstrate the flaws with direct realism, I've been meaning to read more about him for a while but I've currently been focusing on Nagarjuna and Candrakirti.

*We carry around a big set of notions, just in case.

 &amp;nbsp;

 &amp;nbsp;

Yes, there are facts about me being a certain person in a certain context with certain desires. These can very easily involve me not liking various events, forces or other actors that get in the way of my desires, that change my context, or that interrogate who I am as a person. ***Can't they just let me enjoy my [desire] in peace?***

But I've fulfilled all my desires over and over again. I've had that food, that drink, that experience, that object. I've done it all. And then I just keep wanting more. And those wants lead to being a new person, in a new context, with new desires. And now I recreate who and what I don't like anew as well.

 &amp;nbsp;

This chain doesn't seem to contain a satisfying conclusion. So look at it carefully, cultivate dispassion, and set down such facts. They aren't valuable facts, as they spring wholly out of unsatisfying conditions. Limiting yourself to these facts limits you to their provisional usefulness, and even if you're extremely lucky that's never going to last more than a lifetime.","My interpretation/understanding is that holding onto such thoughts, you will generate hatred for your perceived enemy and keep you stuck.

Moving past such thoughts is the path to healing.

Frankly, modern therapy says basically the same thing in this regard.

‚ÄúHow wonderfully is a man‚Äôs love transformed by the interior experience of this nothingness and this nowhere.1 The first time he looks upon it, the sins of his whole life rise up before him. No evil thought, word, or deed remains hidden. Mysteriously and darkly they are burned into it. No matter where he turns they confront him until after great effort, painful remorse, and many bitter tears he has largely rubbed them away. At times the sight is as terrible as a glimpse of hell and he is tempted to despair of ever being healed and relieved of his sore burden. Many arrive at this juncture in the interior life but the terrible, comfortless agony they experience facing themselves drives them back to thoughts of worldly pleasures. They seek without for relief in things of the flesh, unable to bear the spiritual emptiness within. But they have not understood that they were not ready for the spiritual comfort which would have succored them had they waited.2 He who patiently abides in this darkness will be comforted and feel again a confidence about his destiny, for gradually he will see his past sins healed by grace. The pain continues yet he knows it will end for even now it grows less intense. Slowly he begins to realize that the suffering he endures is really not hell at all, but his purgatory.3 Then will come a time when he recognizes in that nothingness no particular sin but only the lump of sin itself, which though but a formless mass is none other than himself; he sees that in himself it is the root and pain of original sin. When at other times he begins to feel a marvelous strengthening and untold delights of joy and goodness, he wonders if this nothingness is not some heavenly paradise after all. And finally there will come a moment when he experiences such peace and repose in that darkness that he thinks surely it must be God himself.

No evil thought, word, or deed remains hidden. Mysteriously and darkly they are burned into it. No matter where he turns they confront him until after great effort, painful remorse, and many bitter tears he has largely rubbed them away. At times the sight is as terrible as a glimpse of hell and he is tempted to despair of ever being healed and relieved of his sore burden. Many arrive at this juncture in the interior life but the terrible, comfortless agony they experience facing themselves drives them back to thoughts of worldly pleasures. They seek without for relief in things of the flesh, unable to bear the spiritual emptiness within. But they have not understood that they were not ready for the spiritual comfort which would have succored them had they waited.2 He who patiently abides in this darkness will be comforted and feel again a confidence about his destiny, for gradually he will see his past sins healed by grace. The pain continues yet he knows it will end for even now it grows less intense. Slowly he begins to realize that the suffering he endures is really not hell at all, but his purgatory.3 Then will come a time when he recognizes in that nothingness no particular sin but only the lump of sin itself, which though but a formless mass is none other than himself; he sees that in himself it is the root and pain of original sin. When at other times he begins to feel a marvelous strengthening and untold delights of joy and goodness, he wonders if this nothingness is not some heavenly paradise after all. And finally there will come a moment when he experiences such peace and repose in that darkness that he thinks surely it must be God himself. Yes, he will suppose this nothingness to be one thing and another, yet to the last it will remain a cloud of unknowing between him and his God.‚Äù&lt;/p&gt;

In any case, yes, zen is deeply steeped in Yogacara thought. It is a Yogacara-Madhyamaka synthesis, but is quite important. Chan, and as a consequence Zen (I imagine), places greater emphasis on Nagarjuna's Mahaprajnaparamita Upadesa, in terms of commentarial lineage, but I'd argue this is still a pretty Yogacara-heavy text. Focus on the Yogacarabhumisastra seems like it declined in China, but was revitalized around the late 18th century in southern China and Taiwan.

I am not sure how long this lasted, but it also began the Yogacara revival in the Vietnamese traditions, which continues to this day (perhaps ironically as an attempt to de-Sinicize Vietnamese Buddhism, and return to a more balanced approach that gives slightly greater authority to Indic ideas and philosophies). The Yogacarabhumisastra is part of the monastic curriculum for Vietnamese Thien today, and follows studies of the Mahaprajnaparamita.","Yogacara is influential in Zen, specifically the style of Yogacara that developed in China which integrates heavily the Tathagatagarbha or Buddha Nature. This is something orthodox Yogacarins from India or of the Faxiang lineage weren‚Äôt particularly keen on. 

So while the Cheng Wei Shi Lun later had a strong impact during the Ming dynasty Yogacara revival, during its formative period it is texts like the Awakening of Faith, Lankavatara, Surangama, etc. which had the strongest impact on Zen. In other words the older Yogacara lineages of Bodhiruci and Paramartha as opposed to Xuanzang who people normally associate with Yogacara.

In addition, by the Ming dynasty practitioners had began to differentiate between the Cittamatra and Vijnaptimatra with the former associated with the hybrid schools and the latter being XZ or orthodox Yogacara. Employing the popular ÊÄßÁõ∏/Nature and Appearance paradigm the hybrid tradition was said to directly discuss the true nature and mind of sentient beings and the orthodox with its voluminous analysis of consciousness was thought to be focusing on the appearance of the mind.",,,,,,,,,,,

&amp;#x200B;

Meditation is extremely helpful, but my mental problems are very deep. I have no teacher or community of fellow meditators/Buddhists on account of the current lockdown in my country and my personal lack of experience with practice. Moreover, my practice has been disturbed over the last two months due to living next to construction work. In a recent depressive episode I self harmed quite severely (with no intention of suicide) and ended up needing urgent medical attention. I was taken to A&amp;E, my wounds were dealt with, and I was assessed by a psychiatrist. I was judged competent to return home and no medication was prescribed (n.b. I have significant experience with antidepressant medication and have no particular aversion to it if advised by a doctor). I was told that I will be referred to another psychiatrist and may be prescribed medication at that point. I was also advised to practice mindfulness.

&amp;#x200B;

I almost laughed at the suggestion to be honest. Here I am, ostensibly trying to practice mindfulness and clearly not doing a very good job at it, falling into medical care and being referred back where I started to mindfulness as a treatment for my mental illness. If anything, self harm has been a practice of wrong mindfulness for me. When my thoughts are out of control and I find myself suffering because of that, the sensation of physical pain brings all of my focus into the present moment and, briefly, stops the suffering of thought. Nonetheless, I am taking the suggestion quite seriously. I am trying to begin practicing loving kindness meditation but finding this extremely difficult. I continue to see a psychotherapist as well, just for context.

&amp;#x200B;

So in treating my depression I have been given an affirmation of practice. This brings me to the questions I ask in the title of this post; one is about theory, the other about practice. I know that I should not injure myself deliberately as it only brings me needless suffering. Does anything further I could read on the subject of mental illness or self harm from a Buddhist perspective? I would greatly appreciate any help with this.

&amp;#x200B;

Secondly, I believe that mindfulness is very helpful and that meditation works. This has been my experience of practice, my understanding of what I have read and heard, and even been impressed upon me by medical professionals. However, something is clearly wrong with my practice, or I am simply not skilled enough to get the benefits I need from it. Does anyone know what sort of meditation is considered most psychiatrically beneficial for depressives? I'm always unsure exactly what is being advised when doctors suggest mindfulness. Or does anyone have any advice for how I should change my practice to deal with urges to hurt myself?

I hope you are having a good day today and thank you for sharing this with us. I‚Äôm not sure I can answer your question in full, but here goes. 

From a Buddhist perspective, no, you should not be harming yourself. This could be considering an attachment to pain, and a big function of Buddhism is dealing with attachment and letting that go. That‚Äôs a very simple explanation. 

You must also remember that Buddhism and mindfulness are not near the equal of proper psychological therapy and medication for serious mental health concerns. It cannot replace, or act as those things, and as your description of your mental health issues seem quite severe, I‚Äôd caution about diving into Buddhism without proper psychological supports set up alongside your practice. I‚Äôm sorry to be blunt, but although practicing Buddhism might help roughen out some edges, you need to find proper help. I‚Äôm not sure what country you‚Äôre in, but finding a registered psychologist is another way of getting help other than a psychiatrist. Might be interesting to look into cognitive-behavioural therapy or solution focused brief therapy to help manage episodes. 
 
I‚Äôd also caution a bit when reading psychological interpretations of Buddhism, as in the past many Western psychologists have misinterpreted the teachings. Give Sravasti Abbey a look on Youtube. They have a strong online presence and a fairly accessible online community. They have over 9000 videos. If you search through their playlists, I think you‚Äôd find something that would help for sure. They teach the Dharma in a way which is really accessible for Westerners and beginners in Buddhism. They also teach courses over zoom that you can sign up for by giving a donation. This could help you learn the Dharma and connect you to a Sangha. 

For more info on the connections between psychological, self harm and Buddhism, you might want to head over to Google Scholar and plug in those words. You‚Äôll find relevant and peer reviewed journal articles there that might give you better insight than us. 

I hope this helps. I hope that today is a good day for you. Please remain kind to yourself and remember to forgive yourself when that‚Äôs not possible.","I'm glad you're safe now and hope you are well. These are some points I would consider if I were you:

1. Finding an antidepressant that works for you can be very helpful to practice, at least in my experience. While it may be possible to address depression symptoms like brain fog and mindlessness with enough practice alone, treating depression with everything you can (medication, exercise, diet, sleep hygiene, light therapy, etc.) may help give you relief sooner and more easily. So just remember that it is okay to treat depression in ways other than mindfulness alone. Medicine is okay and may be worth looking into, as other answers have said.

2. You are not failing at mindfulness if you still experience symptoms of depression after inconsistent/unsustained practice. I remember a metaphor from Ajahn Chah that I read in the book Food for the Heart in the Thai Forest Tradition: mindfulness is like rubbing two sticks together to start a fire. If you start, stop, start, stop, and so forth, you may get some heat, but a fire will probably not come. You can do this as long as you want and never see results. It is easy to become discouraged if you practice in this way. On the other hand, sustaining constant practice independently of whether you get results yet may give you a fire. Just have patience and keep going. Don't care about whether you get results yet. Start right here, right now, then just keep going. (If sustaining nearly-constant mindfulness isn't possible yet, just keep going and it will gradually become more and more constant). It is like pouring water from a teapot: mindfulness in everyday life starts out as inconsistent drips separated by gaps of mindlessness, but just keep going and the drips will turn into a constant stream (another metaphor from Ajahn Chah).

3. I'm not sure how you're learning to practice, but I would recommend learning mindfulness and meditation from monastics or mindfulness/meditation instructors. Psychiatrists and therapists are experts in psychiatry and therapy, not necessarily experts in mindfulness or meditation. I have received some questionable mindfulness advice from psychiatrists and therapists (for example, a therapist once told me that my practice was going well if I became so relaxed during sitting meditation that I fell asleep). With that said, it may also be helpful to look into Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) or Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) if you want some forms of mindfulness that are clinically used to treat depression. There are many great teachers/books/videos on ACT and MBSR that you may find helpful.

4. In addition to metta (e.g., ""may I be happy, may I be healthy, may I be safe, may I be at peace""), one practice that has helped me is recognizing that wanting is a mental feeling that is temporary, unsatisfactory, and non-self. Wanting in the mind is a non-self feeling that comes and goes on its own, outside of my control. I do not need to identify with it, interact much with it, or have much interest in it compared to a baseline object of meditation such as the breath or body. If an urge arise that pulls attention away from the breath or body, I often welcome it with feelings of unconditional warmth and goodwill. Then I label the experience as Wanting, thank Wanting for coming to visit, and let Wanting come and go on its own. No need to engage with it.

201,,Buddhism,"I had a discussion with a friend of mine who is a staunch atheist, with absolutely no patience for religions and the supernatural. With buddhism he takes issue with Karma, or at least the ""supernatural"" version of Karma, that affects who you will be in a future life, or who you were born as in this one.   


Anyways, we started talking about morality and I told I felt buddhism is, of the major religions, the one with the best track record for peace. He said he agreed but that Buddhism takes it too far. Now I'll paraphrase the conversation between me and him a bit.  


Me: What do you mean when you say that Buddhism takes non-violence too far?  


Him: What I mean is, Buddhists, some at least, would say that violent intervention to stop Nazi Germany was wrong, because killing is *always* wrong. Buddhists would rather talk about compassion and non-violence rather than actively trying to stop it, even by force, because of this magic karma force that governs rebirth, for which, there is no evidence by the way. I'm talking about when shit has already hit the fan and the non-violent option hasn't worked.  


Me: I think the main point is that killing can never be skillful and meritorious in buddhism, but it's up to you, regardless if you're a buddhist or not, to decide wether violence is an option you want to pursue.

Him: Sure, go with the violent option, and watch as other buddhists condemn and shun you for it, whilst they sit somewhere and feel great about their selfish brand of ""compassion"" for the victims *and* the perpetrators, safe in the knowledge that at least their *own* karma is unaffected by what is happening. Look, I don't think violence is always the answer, but to nazi germany, to ISIS and the like, violence is the only option when things have already gone bad and people are dying. I've even seen buddhists claim that, because you can't know how each person's death is like, it's wrong to stop them from dying, in, say a gas chamber in Poland. Hey, they might die at peace, and it would be wrong to keep from that. But I can assure you of two things: 1. The Jews and others who were killed by the nazis suffered a great deal. 2. That the nazis wouldn't give a single fuck about your ""loving-kindness"" and think it was great you had compassion enough for them not to stop them. Lastly, I'm also more certain that being saved by a war effort from the concentration camps would be far more apprecieated than just being left to their fate because ""killing is wrong"" because ""muh karma"". 

Me: I don't think every buddhists out there views karma as a supernatural force, some view it as cause and effect, both in terms of events and mental states.  


Him: That's irrelevant when people are suffering in THIS life. Why are buddhists so unconcerned with people in THIS LIFE?

I think this point of yours reflects the historical reality.

&gt;Sure, go with the violent option, and watch as other buddhists condemn and shun you for it

I think this does not reflect the historical reality, but I'll ask someone who knows more about this to answer.

/u/animuseternal, during the struggle to liberate Vietnam from the French and then during the war between the North and South, did the Buddhists who decided to remain non-violent condemn those who fought or ""shun"" them? I would be really surprised if it turned out that this was a common response.

&gt;I've even seen buddhists claim that, because you can't know how each person's death is like, it's wrong to stop them from dying, in, say a gas chamber in Poland. Hey, they might die at peace, and it would be wrong to keep from that

What? I definitely don't know of Buddhists who think you shouldn't *save* lives. If you can save a life without killing anyone, that's great. 

&gt;I don't think every buddhists out there views karma as a supernatural force

All traditional Buddhists view karma as relevant to events in this life and the next. Thinking otherwise is a bit of a modernist tendency. However, that can *still* be a set of truths about mental states, especially because many Buddhist philosophers have either argued that most seemingly independent events are actually mind-dependent, or that there literally are no extra-mental events. So karma can be both psychological *and* about events in the world if those philosophers are correct.

Anyway, that isn't really related to your overall post, just wanted to throw it out there.

&gt;are we as buddhists enablers of genocide and other atrocities as my friend seem to think?

Insofar as we Buddhists are not really a large portion of the world population and very devout Buddhists are unlikely to even be in the kinds of positions which would allow one to have choices to kill others, I don't really get how I could be enabling anything at the scale of a genocide. If I were the president of a powerful country, maybe I could enable a genocide.",self,,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6WnaTZMRlUk4JpMZ2zapWSguSEF6epant4wZs7go038.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=f08e4f308d4f6a95df6968aaa84fbe8dbcccc248', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6WnaTZMRlUk4JpMZ2zapWSguSEF6epant4wZs7go038.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d2e907fa2272b339589b378d674b51e57666994f', 'width': 108, 'height': 81}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6WnaTZMRlUk4JpMZ2zapWSguSEF6epant4wZs7go038.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6597c51aec1e1d00aacf63fe2da2692310aa4cac', 'width': 216, 'height': 162}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/6WnaTZMRlUk4JpMZ2zapWSguSEF6epant4wZs7go038.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=01dba015722cc52efc02d5ccffa4e2df32553040', 'width': 320, 'height': 240}], 'variants': {}, 'id': 'JcE4TxquaErMhv13J_ruP4ikOxRtPSqcFVMX_MDVvhs'}], 'enabled': False}",,,,,,,

A kind person typically has a good reputation and the acts themselves are selfless and wholesome. 

&gt;	Four sublime states of mind have been taught by the Buddha:

-Love or Loving-kindness (metta)
-Compassion (karuna)
-Sympathetic Joy (mudita)
-Equanimity (upekkha)

&gt;In Pali, the language of the Buddhist scriptures, these four are known under the name of Brahma-vihara. This term may be rendered by: excellent, lofty or sublime states of mind; or alternatively, by: Brahma-like, god-like or divine abodes.

&gt;These four attitudes are said to be excellent or sublime because they are the right or ideal way of conduct towards living beings (sattesu samma patipatti). They provide, in fact, the answer to all situations arising from social contact. They are the great removers of tension, the great peace-makers in social conflict, and the great healers of wounds suffered in the struggle of existence. They level social barriers, build harmonious communities, awaken slumbering magnanimity long forgotten, revive joy and hope long abandoned, and promote human brotherhood against the forces of egotism.

&gt;The Brahma-viharas are incompatible with a hating state of mind, and in that they are akin to Brahma, the divine but transient ruler of the higher heavens in the traditional Buddhist picture of the universe. In contrast to many other conceptions of deities, East and West, who by their own devotees are said to show anger, wrath, jealousy and ‚Äúrighteous indignation,‚Äù Brahma is free from hate; and one who assiduously develops these four sublime states, by conduct and meditation, is said to become an equal of Brahma (brahma-samo). If they become the dominant influence in his mind, he will be reborn in congenial worlds, the realms of Brahma. Therefore, these states of mind are called God-like, Brahma-like.

&gt;They are called abodes (vihara) because they should become the mind‚Äôs constant dwelling-places where we feel ‚Äúat home‚Äù; they should not remain merely places of rare and short visits, soon forgotten. In other words, our minds should become thoroughly saturated by them. They should become our inseparable companions, and we should be mindful of them in all our common activities.",,,,,,,,,,,,

""Many deities and men, yearning after good, have pondered on blessings. Pray, tell me the greatest blessing!"" 

[The Buddha:] 
""Not to associate with the foolish, but to associate with the wise; and to honor those who are worthy of honor ‚Äî this is the greatest blessing.

To reside in a suitable locality, to have done meritorious actions in the past and to set oneself in the right course ‚Äî this is the greatest blessing.
 
To have much learning, to be skillful in handicraft, well-trained in discipline, and to be of good speech ‚Äî this is the greatest blessing.

To support mother and father, to cherish wife and children, and to be engaged in peaceful occupation ‚Äî this is the greatest blessing.

To be generous in giving, to be righteous in conduct, to help one's relatives, and to be blameless in action ‚Äî this is the greatest blessing.

To loathe more evil and abstain from it, to refrain from intoxicants, and to be steadfast in virtue ‚Äî this is the greatest blessing.

To be respectful, humble, contented and grateful; and to listen to the Dhamma on due occasions ‚Äî this is the greatest blessing.

To be patient and obedient, to associate with monks and to have religious discussions on due occasions ‚Äî this is the greatest blessing.

A mind unruffled by the vagaries of fortune, from sorrow freed, from defilements cleansed, from fear liberated ‚Äî this is the greatest blessing.

I also have absolutely no guarantee that I will have the same great opportunities in a next life. Maybe I will not even have access to Buddhism, maybe I will live a miserable life, maybe I will be a pig enclosed in a cubicle, etc.

If life is always transforming, moving, changing, being impermanent, the ""now"" is nothing but an illusion. I love everyone today, but soon enough I won't remember any of it and maybe I will have the same thought process in another life, so what's the point?

Exiting Samsara also seems boring. The ups and downs, the exchange with other sentient beings, this makes life something thrilling. So why would I *not* want this? Why would I want to be in a constant while so many beings are suffering without even knowing it? And if everything is impermanent, how exiting the Samsara is permanent?

Some readings says our mind simply can not comprehend, so we need to let our mind rest (and not try to make sense of it) as a way to let our true nature be, or something.

&lt;p&gt;If life is always transforming, moving, changing, being impermanent, the &amp;quot;now&amp;quot; is nothing but an illusion. I love everyone today, but soon enough I won&amp;#39;t remember any of it and maybe I will have the same thought process in another life, so what&amp;#39;s the point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exiting Samsara also seems boring. The ups and downs, the exchange with other sentient beings, this makes life something thrilling. So why would I &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; want this? Why would I want to be in a constant while so many beings are suffering without even knowing it? And if everything is impermanent, how exiting the Samsara is permanent?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some readings says our mind simply can not comprehend, so we need to let our mind rest (and not try to make sense of it) as a way to let our true nature be, or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you can see, my line of thought is a mess right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any tips, books, etc? Thanks for your time reading this.&lt;/p&gt;

In general, it seems to me overall that if one has sort of doubts or concerns when it comes to the Dharma, one is misunderstanding or at least incompletely understanding at least one of these three aspects.

In today's world, it seems to me that a lot of people who are big on like... detachment and rejection of worldly life and whatever are sort of ... not fully understanding the second aspect of cultivating virtue.

In general, basically speaking this more or less relates to the brahmaviharas, and this more or less leads to a harmonious relationship with appearance, with beings, with the world, etc.

FWIW.","Why would you not want samsara? Because old age, sickness and death, seperation from beloved is inevitable. People who enjoy youth so much usually get depressed in old age because their source of happiness is sensuality and they don't have it when they're old and sick. If for not anything else you should prepare yourself for old age by establishing a meditation practice. So when you are old and alone you have an undying source of happiness. Another thing, even though death is not the end, there is a lot of danger in the process. You were lucky to have a good life, you may not be so lucky next time. If you don't want to depend on luck you want to prepare for death. You prepare by meditating and conditioning your mind with skillful actions. So when the time comes your mind makes a skillful decision and takes a good birth.",,,,,,,,,,

This ""What are you doing?"" is itself always polishing a tile. This land and the other world may differ, but the essential message of polishing a tile never ceases.

We should know that, just as we may see the Buddha without knowing or understanding Him, so we may see rivers and yet not know rivers, may see mountains and yet not know mountains.

We gradually train in letting go of our self-importance. This training does not mean that we have enable destructive behavior in others, nor that we should get down on ourselves when we are simply not able to help someone. 99.9999...% of the pain and suffering in the countless universes not even Avalokiteshvara or Manjushri can do didley squat about in any direct sense. 

Which is one reason why this training isn't necessarily about actually *helping* beings. But more subtly: often (maybe usually) when we try and help people it is because we want to be The Helpers. It's because we want to be good boys and girls. Maybe it's even because we want to be Spiritual and Buddhist. In other words, it is about us. It's just another way to enable out own self-centeredness. 

There's a nice Zen story about two practitioners discussing how Avalokiteshvara ""functions"" as a Bodhisattva. One of them opines it's like someone adjusting their pillow in their sleep. It's a nice answer, I think. When we've actually given up our self-clinging, many of the questions we have now, simply don't come up. 

In any case. Maybe there's a few points to contemplate. You say this friendship is causing you distress. What is distressing you? That your friend doesn't act (and react to you) in the way that you want him to? That your attempts to help don't work the way you want them to?

Another thing could be that you maybe feel that feel thinking your friend is boring and unpleasant is wrong, and that you should feel different. Is that so? Aren't you allowed to have feelings? Or are you only allowed to have noble, lofty feelings? If you're friends with somebody because you feel you *have to be*, I would argue you're not actually a friend to them. The same would maybe be true if you're merely hanging on to this relationship because you feel it's a teachable opportunity for yourself. 

If you're actually friends, though, maybe you could first accept that he's feeling how he feels, you're feeling how you feel, and, you know, *talk*. Not because you're trying to achieve something, but because you're friends. You don't have to be manipulatively ""brutally honest"" to tell your friend that the situation between you right now is bumming you the hell out, and that you don't know how to move forward. Maybe tell him that you love him, and that you are worried about his alcohol and drug use. Maybe go on a day trip together and skip some rocks on the lake. See if you're actually still friends. 

In other words: maybe don't try to control the situation, either in your own heart, or your friend's. You can't, and I'd offer the suggestion that trying to is what's *actually* distressing you here.

Just some thoughts. Good luck, also to your friend.","Similar situation - childhood friend turns rather toxic - never ending issues, torn between helping or walking away. In the end, found it better to keep a distance for my own mental well-being.

 Some problems are just not meant for you to fix nor get involved with.","It sounds like your friend wouldn‚Äôt be a good influence on their kids if that‚Äôs how they‚Äôre acting. I‚Äôd also consider you may never see your loan repaid if their life keeps going the way you‚Äôre describing. Ultimately, you need to consider what you‚Äôre enabling even with compassion. In fact, it‚Äôs more compassionate to *not* enable the destructive behavior.",,,,,,,,,,

In general, Buddhism advises against killing, and one of the 5 lay precepts has to do with not killing. Sometimes, depending on your source, it is explained that to fully break the precept one must kill a person, and killing animals doesn't entirely break the precept although it does sort of weaken it or damage it and requires confession, etc.

In general I think when it comes to recreational fishing, it would be advised against more categorically perhaps.

One aspect of karma has to do with basically being happy with the action. 

It's sometimes explained that there are four aspects to a full karmic imprint - knowing a situation clearly, choosing to do something, doing it, and then being satisfied afterwards.

So, say, if you are driving down a dark road and a person dressed in dark clothes steps in front of your car and you hit and kill them, you didn't know the situation, you didn't intend to kill them, you did kill them, but you are (presumably) not happy about it afterwards. So this is different than purposefully running someone down, for instance.

In the case of fishing for livelihood, it may be that the first 3 aspects are intact but one is not happy about it and wishes to find a different way of living that is more harmonious or whatever. That still has an effect, perhaps, but it's not necessarily the same as if all 4 aspects of the full karmic impression are complete. If that makes sense.","The results of kamma is one of the imponderables. If you have to fish, you have to. That is about all there is to say about it. 

If you want some kind of guideline, maybe consider that killing an animal is a ""confession"" transgression for a monk, similar to digging the ground and such. The heavy offenses deal with killing people etc.

But just how it affects us, we do not know. We know that merit dilutes demerit and that fishing and killing fish is demerit.",,,,,,,,,,,

In Shin salvation means that the Shin adherent is rescued from taking another birth into samsara, and is guaranteed birth in the Pure Land.

Birth in the Pure Land entails our oiriginal Mahayana aspiration toward Buddhahood. Amitabha Buddha's grace and merit spark or vivify our formerly ""dormant"" Buddha Nature, and we ourselves become Buddhas.

Unlike Christianity, Shin has no gap between Creator and creature. The best the Christian can hope for is a state of eternal bliss united with his/her Creator, but the Christian - even in heaven - can still only be a ""very blessed"" creature. Not so in Shin, because the Buddha is not a Creator, and is not a deity who saves souls from hell. The only gap between a Shin adherent in this world/in this life and Amida in His Pure Land is one of realization of our Buddha Nature. Amida Buddha has realized His Buddha Nature - and His grace ""awakens"" our own Buddha Nature upon our entry into the Pure Land.

Thus, while on earth, Amitabha does function as a savior inasmuch as He grants us ""the state of non-retrogression"" (not falling back into self-power methods and ""calculating thinking"" that give us an attitude that Bodhi can be earned by our own effort), and He grants us Shinjin - ""perfect faith"" - *perfect* because it does not originate with our self power but rather with the Buddha's Other Power.

On taking our birth in the Pure Land, Amitabha no longer functions as a savior, because at that point we ourselves have, through His grace, attained Buddhahood. For us on earth He is our savior; but in the Pure Land we can now embrace Him as an elder brother and fellow Buddha. Christianity claims merely mystical union with God and Jesus in a state of perpetual grace. But Shin claims that we actually become Buddhas ourselves The gap that existed between us on earth and Amida in the Pure Land dissolves once we ourselves become Buddhas.","This is just semantics, don't get too hung up on the word ""salvation"". I find that Buddhist writers who are rooted in Christian thinking tend to use words like that and, yeah, it's pretty weird. Sometimes a writer will use a word like that because they're not entirely familiar with the nuances of English and ""salvation"" is a word they're most familiar with because of those aforementioned writers rooted in Christian thinking.",self,,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/9T9KvfqhbYDSN-fOdHMm1M_t7UFOC3N-W5f8PJKgt9c.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=34ebb127028acbe94e356c4919dc260083cb195a', 'width': 396, 'height': 325}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/9T9KvfqhbYDSN-fOdHMm1M_t7UFOC3N-W5f8PJKgt9c.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cede1e9d7dc6ffcc2cf4e94607413d0114c5d35d', 'width': 108, 'height': 88}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/9T9KvfqhbYDSN-fOdHMm1M_t7UFOC3N-W5f8PJKgt9c.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c0212ab0d60a8b65c29dc29448dff3842fcb1519', 'width': 216, 'height': 177}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/9T9KvfqhbYDSN-fOdHMm1M_t7UFOC3N-W5f8PJKgt9c.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9af068d43913c4769005fd675fa104c31c5b01af', 'width': 320, 'height': 262}], 'variants': {}, 'id': '-SWUjgYbB4j9XWzIWHOCcyqKNYffPxGsm12x3kqb5LE'}], 'enabled': False}",,,,,,,

**Step 2** \- Find your Sangha, (local Buddhists community) ([How to find](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewBuddhists/comments/lilu3t/how_to_find_an_sangha_zoom_edition/)?) ([What to avoid](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewBuddhists/comments/la1n1l/stay_away_from_these_groups_for_beginners/)?)

**Step 3** \- Yes we forgot something in Step 2. The traditions. Get to know them. ([Book](https://www.amazon.com/Buddhism-One-Teacher-Many-Traditions/dp/1614293929/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1615164843&amp;sr=8-1)) ([Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8eBvDiMGB6I))

**Step 4** \- Choose your tradition. Or not, in which case, you can explore around, read, listen and watch everything. But you will eventually pick one for the #2 above.

&amp;#x200B;

* **a)  For Theravada School**. Go back to Step #2 and use terms ""*Theravada Buddhist Your City*"" or *""Thai Forest Buddhist Your City""* in your Google search. Immerse yourself in the [resources for beginners](https://www.dhammatalks.org/). Start reading the [Suttas](https://suttacentral.net/). (The Buddhist 'Bible') Read the [Dhammapada](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/dhp/dhp.intro.budd.html). You might actually want to get [In The Buddha's Words](https://www.amazon.com/Buddhas-Words-Anthology-Discourses-Teachings/dp/0861714911/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=). I read that every night. Watch [this overview](https://youtu.be/dYZH0UiiMw0). Start meditating. (Book: [Practical Insight Meditation](https://www.amazon.com/PRACTICAL-INSIGHT-MEDITATIONS-Progressive-Stages/dp/9552400899)) (Book: [Mindfulness, Bliss &amp; Beyond](https://www.amazon.com/Mindfulness-Bliss-and-Beyond-audiobook/dp/B01DTI1RRE/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&amp;keywords=ajahn+brahm&amp;qid=1615166658&amp;sr=8-2)) You can get those for free if you Google. (Audio: [Mindfulness In Pain English](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCKjNODBNL8)) Get on a meditation retreat like this one with Ajahn Brahm. ([9 Day Meditation Retreat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aRGeIVgjmjI&amp;list=PLf9HOK_Rf1M5X9m9g0ElcsCWMl0DTXeE3)) But do the #2 above as soon as you can. They'll be able to help you and provide you with a lot of support and free literatures. Like this (Book: [With Each &amp; Every Breath](https://www.dhammatalks.org/ebook_index.html#big_books)) Check out r/theravada for more specific questions you might have later on.

&amp;#x200B;

* **b)  For Mahayana**, there are so [many schools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_of_Buddhism#Mah%C4%81y%C4%81na_schools). I'll focus on the most popular ones in the West, with a lot of temples and monasteries near you. Those are Zen Buddhism and Tibetan Buddhism. For Zen Buddhism, check this out. (Video: [How To Begin With Zen Buddhism](https://youtu.be/9IkucsULmZo)) As you can see, the first thing you need to do is #2 above. You'll need to use the keywords *""Zen Buddhist Your City""* on Google. Then going back to your Zen Video, he said start in small bites. Start with Meditation, he said. (Book: [The Miracle of Mindfulness](https://www.amazon.com/Miracle-Mindfulness-Introduction-Practice-Meditation/dp/0807012394) is a classic favorite.)

Then he said start listening to lectures. You'll do that at the temple. Online, you can watch a lot here. (Website: [Zen Talks](http://www.chzc.org/talklist.htm)) You can absorb as much Thich Nhat Hanh videos as you can. (Youtube: [Plum Village](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcv7KJIAsiddB2YRegvrF7g)) You can watch this (Film: [The Zen Mind](https://www.amazon.com/s?k=the+zen+mind&amp;i=instant-video&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1)).

Your Zen Buddhist sub is at r/zenbuddhism

&amp;#x200B;

* c)  **For Tibetan Buddhism**, [watch this](https://youtu.be/ZYrBrHqT6ng). Which means you'll have to follow #2 above. Google *""Tibetan Buddhist Your City"".* Make sure you check out the links *How To Find* and *What To Avoid*. And that's about it really. You'll have to go, meet and learn from a lama..........buttttt if you prefer to read and study first to satisfy intellectual curiosity, you can check out my list of reading materials.

**Step 5** \- You're going to follow the guidance of the monk/lama and the fellow Buddhists at your sangha.

A daughter-in-law who is unable to adjust to her husband's family is liable to be kicked out. The person in question was already too belligerent for her own good. The given advice was very appropriate for this person. It may not be appropriate for someone in another place and time. After all, customs and ethical rules change.

The most important point is that the Buddha never gave directions to anyone *ex cathedra*, but always pointed the deeper element behind the recommended action. That element is also how his advice can become more generally applicable. Besides, blindly following advice, whether given by the Buddha or anyone else, is not the way to a happy life.","What it says is that the slave-like wife has no *anger* when threatened by violence...but that's supposed to be true of good Buddhist men as well when threatened with violence. And those who do violence are downward bound in their next life. So how does this condone beating people? All it says is that wives who want to kill, steal, or be super controlling are acting badly, while wives who refrain from anger, greed, etc. (even when threatened) are acting rightly.

May it be that I also not have anger when threatened with a beating, as the slave-like wife...

Yes, you are being very hard on yourself. Ironically that is very egocentric behavior, just like the opposite of thinking we are great or special practitioners. So while it is very beneficial to practice as much as we can, it is not so helpful to think about ourselves or our practice like this.

I wonder if you might go more deeply into the four contemplations at the beginning as a way of building motivation and enthusiasm to practice. If you really feel them, it is samsara that is disheartening and practice brings a lot of light and meaning into our lives.

Also it is hard to practice without a root teacher who inspires us with their example. You will meet your teacher soon enough, and until then just keep going with the best that you can do! No need to worry!","You're doing great, I started ngondro a decade after you. I wish I had even known about Vajrayana at 18! 

Don't worry too much about the root guru thing. A root guru is the one who helps you really understand the nature of mind without a doubt, or they can be considered to be someone who gives you a major empowerment (depending on the school, there is nuance to the term). Regarding the empowerment nuance, actually and truly *receiving* the empowerment means that you have had a realization anyway, so really these two nuances are related quite a bit.

You can take many teachings, empowerments, and build relationships with many great teachers and advance quite a lot without finding a root guru necessarily. Chogyal Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche had 18 Dzogchen teachers and had received a huge amount of major teachings and transmissions before he even found his root guru. So don't get too worked up about it. Practice, study, make contact with teachers where you can.","You are being too harsh on yourself. You just begun. 

I love singing Milarepa songs too. Here is one that I think is appropriate for this context:

 **Nine Hurdles**

A free and resourceful and fully equipped human body  
That's freed of the eight unfree states is not easy to get

To get to the heart of this free and resourceful occasion  
And get past the pleasures of life is not easy to do

To see what is wrong with phenomena of samsara  
And accomplish nirvana is not something easy to do

Although one might practice true Dharma extensively  
The purest conducive conditions don't easily join

A lama who masters instructions and scriptures and logic  
And has a compassionate heart is not easy to find

A student with faith who does not get fed up or exhausted  
And is able to actually practice, not easy to find

A practice environment blessed with the proper conditions  
Free of all hazard and fear is not easy to find

Friends with the same motivation and way to apply it  
Whose thinking accords with your own are not easy to find

A body that's able to work with its pain and its illness  
And do all you bid it is not something easy to find

Although you might get every one of these factors together  
To practice with one-pointed mind is not easy to do  


These are nine things which are difficult factors to come by  
They're difficult, but‚Äî it's these difficult things you must do

Here is the melody, sung by Jim Scott:

You don't have to find a root guru now. However, I recommend you connect with some teachers that inspire you, to support your practice. So many teachers teach online currently.

And here are some other Milarepa songs I really like

It is part of the cultivation of the kind of mind which can put an end to suffering and rebirth and become maximally wise.","Life has no answers.

You can take drugs and hallucinate things that you'll fabricate answers on, but that's just further delusion. You can do the same thing without drugs too. It's just a matter of the ease with which you're able to convince yourself.

Meditation in the Buddhist context is not done to get answers to supposedly deep questions. It's done in order to permanently get rid of greed, hatred and ignorance, thereby attaining an unconditional and permanent happiness and serenity, and to ultimately attain perfect wisdom and compassion. Buddhism is for people who, sooner or later, want to become Awakened Beings, not beings who think they have the answer to everything.

Some people also have very intense visions in meditation. Some people, such as Dudjom Lingpa, had spontaneous and vivid visions pretty much their entire life. But this is not the goal. It's not even helpful to most people. Ultimately, it's as K≈´kai said:

*Full of strange things is the world of yoga (mystical union) in which manifold images appear.  
There is a moment when we are drawn into a luminous world of reality.  
Do not be proud or deceived by it;  
Such a vision is yet provisional.  
Away with all images;  
The great samadhi of void (sunyata) is to be our companion.*",,,,,,,,,,,
231,,Buddhism,"&gt;`This collection of sutta-like passages recounts a long series of dialogues concerning profound points of Dhamma between the arahant Ven. Nagasena and the Bactrian Greek king Milinda (Menander). The king, a philosopher and skilled debater, poses to Ven. Nagasena one question after another concerning the Dhamma, each of which Ven. Nagasena masterfully answers, often with unusually vivid and apt similes. Like so many stories from the Pali canon, this one has a happy ending: the king is so deeply inspired by Ven. Nagasena's wisdom that he converts to Buddhism, hands over his kingdom to his son, joins the Sangha, and eventually becomes an arahant himself.`  
&gt;  
&gt;`The Milindapa√±ha has long been revered by Theravada Buddhists around the world because it addresses many questions of Buddhist doctrine of the sort that often come up in the course of Dhamma study and meditation practice: ""Are pleasant feelings skillful or unskillful?"" ""What is the difference between someone with attachment and someone without?"" ""Can an arahant ever break a Vinaya rule?"" ""Is it better to perform an unwholesome act knowingly or unknowingly?"" ""How far away is the Brahma-world?"" ""Why are some people healthy and others ill; some people attractive and others ugly; some rich, and others poor?"" All told, the king asks some 237 questions`[`[1]`](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/index.html#fn-1) `along these lines, making this one of the most comprehensive and useful Buddhist FAQs`[`[2]`](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/index.html#fn-2) `in existence.`

""As sire, a city-architect, when he wants to build a city, first looks about for a district that is level, not elevated, not low-lying, free from gravel and stone, secure, irreproachable and delightful, and then when he has made level there what was not level and has had it cleared of stumps of trees and thorns, he might build a city there. It would be fine and regular, well planned, the moats and encircling walls dug deep, the city gates, the watch-towers and the ramparts strong, the crossroads, squares, junctions and the places where three or four roads meet numerous, the main-roads clean, level and even, the bazar shops well laid out, the city full of parks, pleasances, lakes, lotus pools and wells, adorned with a wide variety of shrines to devas, the whole free from defects.

Then after a time that city might become rich and prosperous, well stocked with food, secure, successful, happy, without adversity, without accident, crowded with all kinds of people.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;This collection of sutta-like passages recounts a long series of dialogues concerning profound points of Dhamma between the arahant Ven. Nagasena and the Bactrian Greek king Milinda (Menander). The king, a philosopher and skilled debater, poses to Ven. Nagasena one question after another concerning the Dhamma, each of which Ven. Nagasena masterfully answers, often with unusually vivid and apt similes. Like so many stories from the Pali canon, this one has a happy ending: the king is so deeply inspired by Ven. Nagasena&amp;#39;s wisdom that he converts to Buddhism, hands over his kingdom to his son, joins the Sangha, and eventually becomes an arahant himself.&lt;/code&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;The Milindapa√±ha has long been revered by Theravada Buddhists around the world because it addresses many questions of Buddhist doctrine of the sort that often come up in the course of Dhamma study and meditation practice: &amp;quot;Are pleasant feelings skillful or unskillful?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;What is the difference between someone with attachment and someone without?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Can an arahant ever break a Vinaya rule?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Is it better to perform an unwholesome act knowingly or unknowingly?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;How far away is the Brahma-world?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Why are some people healthy and others ill; some people attractive and others ugly; some rich, and others poor?&amp;quot; All told, the king asks some 237 questions&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/index.html#fn-1""&gt;&lt;code&gt;[1]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;along these lines, making this one of the most comprehensive and useful Buddhist FAQs&lt;/code&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/index.html#fn-2""&gt;&lt;code&gt;[2]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;code&gt;in existence.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Revered Nagasena, have you ever seen the Buddha?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, sire.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But have your teachers ever seen the Buddha?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, sire.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Revered Nagasena, if you have never seen the Buddha, and if your teachers have never seen the Buddha, well then, revered Nagasena, there is no Buddha; the Buddha is not manifested here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But, sire, did those former noble warriors exist who were the forerunners of your noble warrior dynasty?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes, revered sir; what doubt is there?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Have you, sire, ever seen the former noble warriors?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, revered sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But have those who have instructed you, sire ‚Äî priests, generals, judges, chief councilors ‚Äî have these ever seen the former noble warriors?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, revered sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;But if you, sire, have not seen the former noble warriors and if your instructors have not seen the former noble warriors, where are the former noble warriors?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Revered Nagasena, articles of use enjoyed by the former noble warriors are to be seen, that is to say, the white sunshade, the turban, the shoes, the yak-tail fan, the treasure of the sword of state, and the couches of great price.

233,,Buddhism,"I am a lifelong practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism as a member of the Soka Gakkai International (SGI) and I just had the opportunity to listen to an excellent lecture by a senior figure in our organization who is responsible for Buddhist study. He emphasized that Buddhism as practiced by us is to help all human beings attain a ""human revolution"": an inner transformation within ourselves and help all other human beings attain the same. Even as we are able to undergo this inner transformation, we also have a responsibility to help other people who are suffering and in hardship to do the same. Nichiren Daishonin emphasized that this could be done by chanting Nam Myoho Renge Kyo and reciting the Lotus Sutra as a way of revering the Lotus Sutra. Other schools may try to get at the same goal by other means. This is the essence and core of Mahayana Buddhism.

The important thing is to respect the inherent dignity of all human life - since all human beings possess the capacity to manifest their inner Buddha nature. As long as we do not forget this, we will be able to live a life of deep meaning.

Get vaccinated.,"I agree that we should all get the vaccine if capable and necessary, but in my mind I‚Äôm having a difficult time. Is this like when on an airplane and we are to give ourselves oxygen first in order to be able to help others that are weak? Or is this the opposite where in the weak and those most susceptible need the vaccine before us, therefore it being less helpful if those of us who are healthy get it before they can? 
Maybe this won‚Äôt be an issue once the majority have been vaccinated, I just don‚Äôt want to take the opportunity away from someone else that needs it more.

Edit: I guess it can be looked at as once we receive the vaccine, we aren‚Äôt as in danger to those who might be more susceptible. But my concerns still remain of being selfish.","tbh I'm just not sure if I should get vaccinated, even when offered. I don't have any real reasons it's just a slight paranoia/mistrust of anything offered to me I guess. Part of me wants to wait until the best type of vaccine comes, which will come in 4-5 years I guess.

All experiences, of all unenlightened beings, arise through [dependent origination](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prat%C4%ABtyasamutp%C4%81da). The universe and its order are merely conventional labels for all those experiences taken together.","The cause and effect natural order is exactly karma. 

The Pali Canon is quiet about where this comes from, it just is. I like the story of the monk, Malunkyaputta, who demands that the Buddha teach on the nature of the cosmos (is it finite or infinite?), time (does it have a beginning? and end?), life force and the body (are they the same? different?) and the life of a Buddha (does the Buddha have an afterlife?). The Buddha rebukes Malunkyaputta, telling him that the Buddha has not and will not speak on these issues. He further explains that what the Buddha does teach, the four noble truths, is plenty ‚Äî it is enough to put an end to suffering which is Malunkyaputta‚Äôs real problem. 

In my opinion this is one of the things that is unique to Buddhism, it is not interested in explaining the world beyond explaining the cause of dukkha. The Buddha is much more interested in what goes on in the mind than why the sun shines or water is wet. He is repeatedly asked about his view on these metaphysical questions and always explains that he has nothing to teach. This seems to irritate some people but the Buddha is doing something very compassionate ‚Äî he is advising his followers not to waste their time, to work on their own enlightenment rather than ponder things beyond their control. It is like he is telling them that somethings are not worth investigating, it can not be changed, let it go and focus on enlightenment.","I can only reply, and partially at that, from the Mahayana school which says - iirc - that the basis of ultimate reality is an eternal expression of Buddha manifestation called ""the Three Buddha Bodies"", the highest yet most primordial of which is called ""the Dharmakaya"".

***The Dharmakaya*** is ineffable, unmanifest, the ""state of absolute knowledge', and is unknowable in itself. In this it resembles the Western ""Godhead"", but although it is creative, it is not a personal conscious creator like the Jewish and Christian Sky Father-type entity.

Because the Dharmakaya is unrepresentable, it can only be ""reflected"" in its other expressions - the two other Buddha Bodies - the  Sambhogakaya (the heavenly Buddhas), and the Nirmanakaya (earthly-manifested Buddha body). These earthly Buddhas utilize their innate expertise at teaching by ""skillful means"" in order to bring transcendental gifts, like the Dharma and Bodhi, to suffering sentient beings struggling in the samsara-world.

So I would hazard the guess that the natural order - the world of samsara - has always existed because the ""mechanics"" of the eternal Buddha Bodies have always existed, and these include a ""union of the opposites"" such as Nirvana and samsara. Some Buddhist schools go so far as to say that there is no meaningful difference between Nirvana and samsara because everything is an active part of a single process.

That's the best I can do at my current state of knowledge/ignorance. Hopefully other, wiser posters will supply the necessary correctives. Good luck on your truth-search.",,,,,,,,,,

If in a given day you perform mostly positive actions and just a few negative actions, those negative actions will still eventually give rise to unpleasant effects. The positive actions are good, but they don't necessarily cancel out the negative actions because every action gives rise to its own effect.

the meaning of: OM MANI PADME HUM
====================================

Praise to the Jewel in the Lotus
*by His Holiness Tenzin Gyatso The Fourteenth Dalai Lama of Tibet*
 
It is very good to recite the mantra OM MANI PADME HUM, but while you are doing it, you should be thinking on its meaning, for the meaning of the six syllables is great and vast. The first, OM, is composed of three pure letters, A, U, and M. These symbolize the practitioner's impure body, speech, and mind; they also symbolize the
pure exalted body, speech and mind of a Buddha.
 
Can impure body, speech and mind be transformed into pure body, speech and mind, or are they entirely separate? All Buddhas are cases of being who were like ourselves and then in dependence on the path became enlightened; Buddhism does not assert that there is anyone who from the beginning is free from faults and possesses all good qualities. The development of pure body, speech, and mind comes from gradually leaving the impure states and their being transformed into the pure.
 
How is this done? The path is indicated by the next four syllables. MANI, meaning jewel, symbolizes the factor of method- the altruistic intention to become enlightened, compassion, and love.  Just as a jewel is capable of removing poverty, so the altruistic mind of enlightenment is capable of removing the poverty, or difficulties, of
cyclic existence and of solitary peace. Similarly, just as a jewel fulfills the wishes of sentient beings, so the altruistic intention to become enlightened fulfills the wishes of sentient beings.
 
The two syllables, PADME, meaning lotus, symbolize wisdom. Just as a lotus grows forth from mud but is not sullied by the faults of mud, so wisdom is capable of putting you in a situation of non-contradiction where as there would be contradiction if you did not have wisdom. There is wisdom realizing impermanence, wisdom realizing
that persons are empty of self-sufficient or substantial existence, wisdom that realizes the emptiness of duality (that is to say, of difference of entity between subject and object), and wisdom that realizes the emptiness of inherent existence. Though there are may different types of wisdom, the main of all these is the wisdom
realizing emptiness.
 
Purity must be achieved by an indivisible unity of method and wisdom, symbolized by the final syllable, HUM, which indicates indivisibility. According to the sutra system, this indivisibility of method and wisdom refers to one consciousness in which there is a full form of both wisdom affected by method and method affected by wisdom.
In the mantra, or tantra vehicle, it refers to one conciousness in which there is the full form of both wisdom and method as one undifferentiable entity. In terms of the seed syllables of the five conqueror Buddhas, HUM is the seed syllable of Akshobhya- the immovable, the unfluctuating, that which cannot be disturbed by
anything.
 
Thus the six syllables, OM MANI PADME HUM, mean that in dependence on the practice which is in indivisible union of method and wisdom, you can transform your impure body, speech and mind into the pure body, speech, and mind of a Buddha. It is said that you should not seek for Buddhahood outside of yourself; the substances for the
achievement of Buddhahood are within. As Maitreya says in his SUBLIME CONTINUUM OF GREAT VEHICLE (UTTARA TANTRA) all beings naturally have the Buddha nature in their own continuum. We have within us the seed of purity, the essence of a One Gone Thus (TATHAGATAGARBHA), that is to be transformed and full developed into Buddhahood.

If you have access to medical services, you could consider looking into getting therapy. Apart from that quitting pot would probably be helpful for your well-being.  

As far as Buddhist advice goes: a fundamental realization in dharma practice is that everything is impermanent. Even our feelings and the fixed ideas we have about ourselves and the world will not stay how they are. We spend a lot of time and energy holding on to things that can't be held on to. That's what makes our lives so consistently frustrating. In stead, we could try to gradually learn to let go, let be. Allow things around us and inside us to go their natural course, and reacting to what actually *happens* rather than to what we hope or fear *could happen*. We're never stuck. However much we are habituated to secretly want to be stuck.

If you feel some connection with Tibetan style Buddhism, I would strongly advise you to recite *om mani padme hum*, the mantra of Great Compassion, the Bodhisattva Avalokiteshvara. If we get into the habit of doing that, when things get overwhelming the mantra may come up and remind us we don't have to trust our confusion but there's actually something actually trustworthy out there, that we can rely on as our refuge.

Just some thoughts. Good luck!","Have you heard of Recovery Dharma? It's a Buddhist inspired program for addicts of all kinds (drugs, alcohol, process addictions, food, sex, etc) and it may be of use to you. I am not saying you're an addict, but they have Zoom meetings multiple time a day, the community is incredibly welcoming, and you can leave your camera off and ease into things as you wish. Check out their website (recoverydharma.org) and see if it speaks to you at all! I think a lot of the material could be really helpful in tackling some of the things you mentioned.

I felt I was in the presence of a genuinely awakened man from how he carried himself, the energy he gave off. He got me started with the most basic meditation practice and the other more experienced students were great examples to learn from. He has helped me shift my practice from endlessly intellectual to simple and experiential. 

I worked with him to found [DharmaRelief.org](https://DharmaRelief.org) a year ago and it changed my life. Through working on that with him, I was able to move to Maui and start a new life while the pandemic took off.

From here, I asked him to be my teacher and he accepted. I've struggled with practice here sometimes getting tangled with desires, wrong views, overthinking. He has encouraged me with kindness and tough love both. With the help of his assistant, I made him his new website: [http://guogulaoshi.com/](http://guogulaoshi.com/).

I'm not the ideal student but I am working on the basics again after feeling burnt out from working too much and not taking care of my health. Ironic that this happened in Maui somehow. Life is so funny. Even here, GG is encouraging me and not putting too much on me.

&lt;p&gt;I saw my bro Derek getting a package from the mail man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enquired if he got the letters also from the mailbox.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He said he didn&amp;#39;t check..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- so he&amp;#39;s so lazy that he only gets his own&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;packages from the porch,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but won&amp;#39;t unlock the letter box..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I was about to yell @ him how inconsiderate / lazy&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;he is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I&amp;#39;ve yelled @ him before&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- which usually results in him&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;walking away in silence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- He&amp;#39;s good @ de-esculation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;unlike me..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Later I realized that the packages he&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;got from the porch actually belonged to me!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- Oh how silly I felt!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- I then realize how powerful Buddist teachings are&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;- They aren&amp;#39;t just colorful stories to past time&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;amp; study on sundays.&lt;/p&gt;

The Jedi are based off of Buddhism and Taoism alike though, while also doing their own thing. 

Keep in mind that the Jedi Council at the time of Yoda was corrupt, and Yoda was effectively their leader. By the time of the Imperial Era, I think Yoda has seen the error of his ways and sought seclusion. 

So given the history here, I‚Äôm not sure Yoda should qualify as really resembling a Buddhist monk. There are distortions here. The extreme view of attachment, and misunderstanding the cause of suffering, is a big one here. This misunderstanding *enables* the Sith and created Darth Vader. But there‚Äôs Buddhist analysis if you want to use it, just as long as it isn‚Äôt so elevated as to suggest the Jedi == Buddhism, because a big point of the Jedi as we see them is the corruption of their original views with politics and dogmatism.","There is the rumor that Lucas partly based the look of Yoda on the Tibetan meditation master [Tsenshab Serkong Rinpoche](https://fpmt.org/teachers/lineage-lamas/serkong/). It's too long ago that I saw any of the movies, but I don't recall anything Yoda said being particularly reminiscent of Buddhist teachings.","Yes, in a sense.

People end up showing up less and less to group meetings or outings until they no longer show up.; Either due to a change in personality or a variety of other different reasons. So I wouldn't worry too much about ending your friendships early but instead let them end naturally. Just make sure in the meantime you don't get pulled back into a lifestyle you don't want to be in, whether that's heavy drinking on the weekends or going to parties during the pandemic. If you think you cant control such interactions then I would just tell your friends you're unable to be around them due to personal reasons. I would stress that you don't hate or dislike them, but you have different goals in life and you want to pursue them and as such you don't want to hang out anymore.

I think in the future though, in regards to making noble friends, you should act how you normally act in public. If you act genuine, you'll eventually attract friends to you that are like-minded and won't diminish you. Don't be afraid of what people will think of your personality or how you act. Ultimately the only person who has to live in your skin is yourself, not the random people you try to become friends with. This takes longer to do, especially if you're younger there will not be many people like you. However, as a Buddhist, eventually, people will appreciate any wisdom that you do provide, they'll appreciate your selfless nature, they'll appreciate your warmth and equanimity, and you'll make friends who don't dim your light but strengthen it. If you try to change who you are for someone else you'll end up attracting the wrong people.","I have been diagnosed with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) but neither fits the stereotypes that you see in movies and TV. I was obsessed with the idea that others would find my behavior weird or creepy and performed in relationships to avoid being judged, taunted and humiliated. Especially in grade school, kids would trick me into doing things and then report it to the teacher, which led to several publicly humiliating experiences. In college, I quit the marching band because I discovered that people were joking about me behind my back. Then I found friends who were more similar like my wife whom I have been with ever since and do not feel any need to pretend. We did both have friends who we drifted away from who were still stuck in party mode years later and no longer felt anything in common with, people mature at different rates. But I do still tend to avoid friendships and socializing in general although I am working to overcome past aversion and self conceit. My aspiration is to alleviate suffering and I recognize that the way that I have been severely limits the power of my aspiration. I do not know if any of the above resonates, you may consider it another perspective. My advice is simply to investigate and be curious about whether aversion plays any part in it, or perhaps greed for specific outcomes, delusions or a lack of compassion.",,,,,,,,,,
273,,Buddhism,"What pushed me to Buddhism was this r/askreddit on Reddit, 2 years ago, when people recounted their near death experiences, and as many people described nothingness, as people who described something supernatural.

Read that and see if you still want to explore Buddhism.","Cults are usually easy to spot:

1. No sense of humour 
2. The guru will make claims of special teachings, revolatations, Enlightenment,  etc.
3. They will bad mouth other schools 
4. Any criticism or awkward questions will result in you getting the cold shoulder 
5. Over-the-top displays of emotion (blubbering when they talk about their teacher,  for example).","Congrats on you on picking up the dharma at the young age.

  Tricycle has a widely recommended start for Buddhism for beginners:

Some of my favorite books myself and ones I recommend are:     
    
  *Joy of Living* by Mingyur Rinpoche. These type of books on how to live a happier life are good even if you're not so keen on Buddhism.       
    
  *Buddhism for Dummies* by Jonathan Landaw. I don't like the title much, am I a dummy? Maybe in some things and not others. Still, a book like this is excellent because it provides an overview of nearly everything in Buddhism. An excellent foundation.     
    
    
   *Introducing Buddha: A Graphic Guide* by Jane Hope &amp; Borin Van Loon. I like the Graphic Guide series quite a bit as they‚Äôre fun to read and provide a great start and overview. Buddhists are often comparatively quite uninformed of the Buddha‚Äôs life and teachings compared to other religions (such as Christianity). If you read *Buddhism for Dummies, Introducing Buddha: A Graphic Guide,* and *What the Buddha Taught* this won‚Äôt be you.     
    
  *What the Buddha Taught* by Walpola Rahula. A classic and good expose of the doctrine the Buddha taught.     
    
  *Why Buddhism is True* by Robert Wright  *Why Buddhism is True* by Robert Wright pairs up quite nicely with *What the Buddha Taught,* as *Why Buddhism is True* eschews entirely the doctrinaire aspect of Buddhism in favor of Buddhism‚Äôs science of the mind. The pair of        books make a nice combo.           
    
  and for Meditation, *Don't Look Down on the Defilements, They'll Laugh At You* by U Tejaniya. You can download his books for free from his website, [https://ashintejaniya.org/](https://ashintejaniya.org/)   
    
  Jack Kornfield's *The Buddha is Still Teaching* has many short excerpts from various books and masters. It makes a nice book to pick up and read for short snippets. It's also good in that you can find other authors and writers you might enjoy reading.     
    
  Kornfield's *Path With a Heart* is a favorite and wonderfully kind book I've read a couple times.     
    
   A very readable book reportedly written by the Buddha is *The Dhammapada.* It's full of wise sayings you've probably seen on Internet memes. I recommend the Gil Fronsdal translation version of *The Dhammapada*.         
  If you like *The Dhammapada,* continue down the early Buddhism path with Gil Fronsdal book, *The Buddha Before Buddhism: Wisdom from the Early Teachings.*         
    
   Some top online options I want to draw your attention to are below.        Coursera. I recommend Robert Wright's *Modern Psychology and Buddhism* course. Free.        [https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-of-meditation](https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-of-meditation)

The Buddha‚Äôs core initial insight into human nature was that we are forever dissatisfied. We do not find lasting happiness or satisfaction in anything we experience, and thus we suffer. We think we‚Äôll be happy when we finally get what we want (e.g. that title, that raises, that house), but we quickly feel unfulfilled and desire the next thing. This is referred to as Dukkha.

If it were, you couldn't know it. Example: If you know that 1 + 1 = 2, then that means you have the ability to do math. If you couldn't do math, you couldn't know that 1 + 1 = 2. This one is using fanciful words to express a very simple and obvious thing: If it can be known, then there is a way to know it.

With the second: Everything that exists was *caused* to exist and *continues* to exist because of various factors in play. Example: a plant exists because a seed was planted, it was watered and received sunlight. It continues to exist because it keeps receiving water and light and CO2. Plants are almost entirely made out of carbon, the carbon they extract from the air. So plants are *dependently originated* (their origin depends on other causes and conditions) and, therefore, they have no properties of their own (everything they are came from something else, including the seed that ""originated"" the plant - that seed came from another plant). Nothing about the plant belongs to the plant.

The third is saying that since things lack their own stuff (""nothing about the plant belongs to the plant""), then the only explanation for why things seem to exist is *dependent origination*. Another way to say it is: Everything is relational. Everything is made of relationships between other things. Nothing is a ""solid object"" on its own. Plants take in sunlight and water and CO2, so plants are a ""relationship"" between those things.","I recommend the short book ""How things really exist""  by Lama Zopa Rinpoche that explains these concepts in easy to understand language.

It is avaible as a free Pdf here: https://www.lamayeshe.com/shop/how-things-exist-book","The wording on this is a little strange, like maybe it's written by a non-native english speaker? Seems to be referring to the Pa·π≠icca-samuppƒÅda (aka dependant origination). This is the idea that nothing has it's own inherent existence, which means that everything exists due to causes and conditions.

I appreciate everyone has their own path and relationship with Buddhism.

If you have been Buddhist for 2 years, how are you not aware of the Devas and Brahmas? Are you not aware of Mara, who tried tempting Buddha under the bodhi tree right before enlightenment? The Devas present for Buddhas original discourse? The ideas of the Deva Realms?

It is just a bit surprising but of course I dont know anything about your path. Everyone approaches Buddhism differently and Buddhism approaches everyone differently.","1. There are gods and deities in Buddhism and they are important but not for the reasons you think.
2. Unless you're a part of certain lineages in Vajrayana you don't need to worship any gods. I would say that if you believe in Rebirth it is ""required"" to believe in them, in the sense that it reinforces the idea of Karma, just like hell beings, animal rebirths, ghost rebirths, etc... reinforce the idea of Karma.

If you ask who is controlling rebirth we don't know, but it doesn't matter in regards to the relief of our suffering.

3. Most of the time in this life no, some gods have interacted with the Buddha at least in the Pali Canon.  They are still important when it comes to rebirth because you can be reborn as one.  But generally, it's not seen as a super good thing, human rebirth is the most favorable rebirth.\*

\*Obvious exceptions being born in Tusita heaven or a Pure land if you're Pure land Buddhist.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was less receptive to the idea of gods and hell-beings, I also decided to not refer to their realms as Deva realms or Hell realms but Good Realms and Bad realms. If I act like a bad person, my interaction with the world around me will be negative and after I die I will be reborn in a realm reflecting my bad mindstate. And vice versa, If I act like a good person, my interactions in this life will be good interactions and after I die I will be reborn in a good realm. This is obviously a very white-washy version of Buddhism but it helped me get into these concepts after being apprehensive with the idea of Gods or gods.","For some the devas and Brahmas are important. For others they are mere demonstration that life exists in different ways and places. In Theravada they are not part of the spiritual path, but can be honored for different reasons.",,,,,,,,,,

282,,Buddhism,"Hi everyone,

I recently finished reading *Sa·πÉsƒÅra, NirvƒÅ·πáa, and Buddha Nature* by the Dalai Lama and Venerable Thubten Chodron, which was an excellent book if anyone is interested. Chapter 10 mentions the ""Ye DharmƒÅ"" DhƒÅra·πáƒ´ and says:

&gt;A dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ - an intelligible phrase that encapsulates the essence of a teaching - that is frequently recited by followers of both the PƒÅli and Sanskrit traditions is the ""Essence of Dependent Arising DhƒÅra·πáƒ´."" In Sanskrit it reads:  
&gt;  
&gt;*Ye dharmƒÅ hetu prabhavƒÅ hetun, te·π£ƒÅ·πÉ tathƒÅgato hyavadat,*  
&gt;  
&gt;*te·π£ƒÅ·πÉ ca yo nirodha, eva·πÉ vƒÅdƒ´ mahƒÅ≈õrama·πáa.*  
&gt;  
&gt;'All phenomena arise from causes. Those causes have been taught by the TathƒÅgata. And their cessation too has been proclaimed by the great renunciant.'  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Before becoming a follower of the Buddha,  ≈öƒÅriputra encountered the arhat A≈õvajit and asked him to explain the essence of the Tath*ƒÅ*gata's teaching to him. A≈õvajit recited these words, and fully understanding their meaning, ≈öƒÅriputra immediately became a stream-enterer. He later recited them to his friend Maudgaly*ƒÅ*yana, who attained the same realization. They and five hundred of their followers then approached the Buddha and requested to become his disciples

&amp;#x200B;

After explaining each part of the dhƒÅra·πáƒ´, the book concludes:

&gt;This short dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ contains great meaning because it incorporates the four truths, the eightfold path, a buddha's truth body that is the perfection of abandonment and realization, and a buddha's form body that acts to benefit all beings with the four self-confidences. A profound understanding of this dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ will enable us to attain the four bodies of a buddha.

&amp;#x200B;

I find it fascinating that such a short statement can incorporate so many different aspects, and I now think about this dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ on a daily basis. What do you think? Do you have any experience with this dhƒÅra·πáƒ´? Would you recommend any related teachings or resources?

Ethical conduct : cultivate the ten virtues and refrain from the ten non-virtues https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Ten_positive_actions

Meditation  : choose a technique to train your mind. If you are interested in  compassion, you can include the four immeasurables and tonglen (the  whole lojong approach is great as a means to integrate practice in your life).  https://www.shambhala.com/lojong-mind-training/

eightfold path by bhikkhu.....Things pertaining to Bodhi (the 37 aids to enlightenment) by Sheng Yen. These are universal teaching, eighfold path will overlap ""the heart of buddhas teaching"" but I feel it is better at being specific in explaining application....

after this I think it would be good to start diving into what fits your spiritual path Tibetan, Zen, Thervada...

Buddhism is kind of like learning a foreign language, it is better to go in a sequence, starting with general understanding and what you should be applying in your life...then dive deeper..I feel I stunted myself for years by not having the established base....leading me to lose faith in the practice, but now I know much more and realize it was being to eager...Knowing how to use buddhism is more important than the depths of your knowledge of buddhism (if that makes sense)",Since you mentioned [new materials](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewBuddhists/comments/k7moww/newbie_required_reading_mahayanavajrayana_path/) to study while considering Tibetan Buddhism...you should [check this out](https://www.reddit.com/r/NewBuddhists/comments/k7moww/newbie_required_reading_mahayanavajrayana_path/).

I think if more people took six months off and spent in a monastery (any kind really) and reflected and meditated , the world would be a different place.

As far as realizations, this is contextual. Different traditions may differ here. I also like Shantideva who his fellow monks thought three realizations were: eating, sleeping, and shitting. Then he gave a talk on the Way of the Bodhisattva. If people claim realization, some special status, it's often a reverse signal. Or even worse give themselves a title (Vanguard, Arahant, God, Bhagavan) -- it shows their ego went along with them on the spiritual trip.

I learned a lot about myself, or should I say I learned a lot about my not-self ;-p. Try to follow instructions. Small steps. Listen. Practice equanimity. Be kind. Act normal. Take everything on the Path as Bodhi.","I've done this before! The reason it benefited me the most is because you are given complete total space to concentrate on your meditation practice. Beforehand my meditation was something that fit around my life, but then going to a retreat flips that around. Giving the meditation the spotlight really pushes you to concentrate more on it, I know that sounds obvious but it is that. Everything you do, think, speak, the way you move, you meditate on everything, you meditate on how you meditate. I think retreats are good for this reason. I found for me anyway.",,,,,,,,,,

While we call them pleasures, they're actually full of frustration: you can never come hard enough, long enough and often enough to actually settle that itch you're trying to settle. After it, at best we feel numb, but do we feel *fulfilled*? If we did, why would we sooner or later crave some other pleasure, of sex, drugs, wealth, fame etc?

This frustration or dissatisfaction is what we call *dukkha*. As long as we habitually cling to thinking we *are* things we quite obviously are *not*, all our cherished emotions and feelings are merely variations on *dukkha.* Our house of cards is constantly tumbling down, and rushing to rebuild it as fast as it self-destructs, exhausts and numbs us, but it doesn't give us a place to live.

My first post here and before I begin I want to thank you all for the insight and advice along the path. I often read many of the posts and it is from this community that someone first gave me the gift of [dhammatalks.org](https://dhammatalks.org) and led me to a Sanga of Buddhism and Meditation on Facebook based out of the UK.

Over the past year I have really found so much peace through Buddhism and meditation.  I used to be quick to anger, addicted to the power and pleasure of the corporate world and at times allowed the ego to lead me. I have been practicing a traditional form of Karate for a very long time and that combined with Buddhism has truly helped me get to where I am... Thanks be to great teachers and I have opened and gone through the doors they have shown me... I know the journey is long and never ending and this actually inspires me with hope and happiness instead of fear or worry.

  
How have many of you deepened your practice over the years? Every day I use a guided meditation or two by Thanisaro (from [Dhammatalks.org](https://Dhammatalks.org)), or one of Thich Nhat Hanh's teaching videos on youtube (my two favorites are his The Art of Mindfull living part 1 and 2). Do you begin each morning with affirmations or chants? This year my family and I are embarking on a life of self dependence focusing on building our farm and forest trails. I have rid myself of the worry of ""will we be ok"" and I trust the path but I am looking to go deeper. Maybe this is just another ego delusion and maybe there is no need for deeper and maybe it is just about being consistent and doing the work...

Thich Nhat Hanh and my local sangha are part of Zen Buddhism. My teacher said that after death we will live on different mental or material or informational components, I don't remember his exact words. I don't think I've ever heard or read Thich Nhat Hanh speaking about people having past or future lives as hell-beings or hungry ghosts or devas or such things of Buddhist cosmology, his approach is much more focused on our lives, our world and day-to-day matters like mindful breathing, mindful walking, and other kind of mindful actions. He often talks what science tells us, and how science is related to Buddhism. Here's an excerpt from Thich Nhat Hanh's book The Other Shore:

&gt;Imagine a hen is about to lay an egg. Before she gives birth, the egg is already inside her. Similarly, you were already inside your mother for nine months before you came out. So it is very clear that before you were born - before the point B - you already existed. The fact is that if something is already there, it does not need to be born. Had you not existed, how could suddenly come into existence? How could you go from being nothing to becoming something.

&gt;Actually, even before your conception you were already there. Half the elements that make up you were inside your mother and the other half inside your father, not only in terms of genes and chromosomes, but in the form of thoughts, beliefs, qualities, and talents. If you look back even further, you will see that you also existed in your grandparents and in your great-grandparents and in their parents and grandparents before that. Looking back you see that there has never been a time you did not exist. The day your mother gave birth to you is not the day you were born. It is just the day you manifested in this form. You have always been there. There is no birth; there is only continuation. Your so called birthday is really your continuation day. The next time you celebrate it, you can say, ""Happy Continuation Day.""

&gt;This is not a question of belief in reincarnation; this is the history of life on Earth. We have been gas, sunshine, water, fungi, and plants. We were single-celled beings. The Buddha said that in one of his former lives, he was a tree, he was a fish, he was a deer. Everyone of us has been a cloud, a deer, a bird and we continue to be these things today.

I think there's a clear difference here. First of all, the Pali Canon is much, much more dark. Second, it seems like Thich Nhat Hanh talks more about the physical and informational components like the qualities or genes of our parents or the energy that came from sunshine or the atoms that came from water.

The way I see it: love is supposed to self-less and unconditional, but attachments are very selfish and are very much conditioned.

Attachment in romantic relationships seem to be more about how the other person makes me feel, what they can do *for* me. Where as love is about selflessly and unconditionally love another person, wishing the very best for them, and one's self isn't really involved in that.

I think most people experience a mix of both. They enjoy the way the other person makes them feel, *and* there's some sense of loving them unconditionally. That can make it difficult to pry the two apart. Romantic love without attachment is free-flowing and boundless. When strong attachment is involved, there's fears and worries involved (""what if they leave me/die"").

Loving someone without being attached to them is very difficult, but one can make progress toward it by generally pursuing the path to liberation the Buddha taught because, over time, it does help to diminish self-clinging. When you cling less and less to the sense of self, that sense of self doesn't appear as strongly in our experiences and that includes our relationships. In other words: the road to letting go of attachments is holistic and can't be confined to specific scenarios such as romantic love.","In general, it seems to me that when it comes to this topic, many people simply can't imagine anything different than their own mind and they essentially just project their view of themselves onto others.

In general, in the Mahayana it is said that a Bodhisattva may take, essentially, any form whatsoever potentially.

See for example [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/9z5jlh/avatamsaka_sutra_on_bodhisattva_householders/) excerpt.

In general, I think you're asking slightly the wrong question.

The question you should be focusing on is what *you* mean by a romantic relationship when it comes to your path, and you should be asking what's appropriate for *you* to do.

For some individuals, it may be appropriate to be in a romantic relationship. For others it may not be.

For some individuals it may be appropriate to, say, live as a monastic doing solitary wilderness meditation. For others it may not be - the Buddha, apparently, forbade his disciple Upali from doing exactly that because it wasn't appropriate for him - it was more appropriate to be in a setting around others. There's not necessarily a one-size-fits-all 'form' that is best for every individual, I think you could say.

In general, again, I think the bottom line is that you just need to apply the Dharma as you are able in your own mind and life. And whether or not that will mean being in a romantic relationship or not, I think, depends simply on what's appropriate for you.

And if you don't feel that you have the wisdom to know what's best, then maybe consider the importance of Sangha, of admirable friends. As is said, 

&gt;Admirable friendship, admirable companionship, admirable camaraderie is actually the whole of the holy life. When a monk has admirable people as friends, companions, &amp; comrades, he can be expected to develop &amp; pursue the noble eightfold path.

So perhaps it might be worthwhile to find or strengthen a connection with admirable friends in the world, so that their influence can sort of rub off on you.

Anyway, FWIW. All the best.","You can appreciate and savor love when it is in your life and let it go when it no longer works. Maybe romantic love doesn‚Äôt always last, but is something that comes and goes like ocean waves. Then every relationship is just a gift you aren‚Äôt meant to keep, and have to give back to the world after some time. 

I think a lot of the toxicity of love in our culture is this delusional idea that it can last forever, or a lifetime, when that is exceptionally rare, and chances are, the love you‚Äôre experiencing right now is just that: a love you have right now, and maybe not the person you want to be with five years from now. A lot of times, it seems we‚Äôre more in love with the idea of love than the person we‚Äôre with, and if that sounds true, maybe love has run its course and it‚Äôs time to let it go. 

That‚Äôs my view on non-attached romantic love anyway.",,,,,,,,,,
295,,Buddhism,"So I've just started reading Thich Nhat Hanhs 'The Heart of The Buddhas Teaching"" and how he speaks of perception strikes me as drastically counter to how it's described in the Pali canon.

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;To perceive always means to perceive something. We believe that the object of our perception is outside of the subject, but that is not correct. When we perceive the moon, the moon is us. When we smile to our friend, our friend is also us because she is the object of our perception.  

^(The Heart of The Buddhas Teaching . Part 2 / Chapter 9) 

&amp;#x200B;

What TNH said is those perception doesn‚Äôt lie on the object, but on the subject. 

However, if you then think that subject is mine, myself, you have wrongly interpreted it. 

Why?
Because there is also no subject either. 

What TNH said is basically just to tell you, when you see something ugly outside, do not blame that object, because what is ugly is not that object, but your own perception that is ugly. 

Knowing your own perception is ugly, also do not think that perception is yours, do not think you are the perception because you are not. 

Then, despite your perception is ugly, you know you are not because you are not your perception. 

Do not be affected by your own perception, because you are not your perception.","I believe that Thich Nhat Hanh is expressing the Yogacara view of nondualism in that passage.

TNH was talking about perception of the ""external"" world and how it may otherwise appear without a sense of self (subject). The Buddha was talking about the five aggregates.

For something more in line with what TNH said:

&gt; ""Then, BƒÅhiya, you should train yourself thus: In reference to the seen, there will be only the seen. In reference to the heard, only the heard. In reference to the sensed, only the sensed. In reference to the cognized, only the cognized. That is how you should train yourself. When for you there will be only the seen in reference to the seen, only the heard in reference to the heard, only the sensed in reference to the sensed, only the cognized in reference to the cognized, then, BƒÅhiya, there is no you in connection with that. When there is no you in connection with that, there is no you there. When there is no you there, you are neither here nor yonder nor between the two. This, just this, is the end of stress.""

The five precepts for laypeople allow sex if it is not misconduct, but the eight precepts for laypeople and the 227-311 precepts for monastics do not.

Maybe this answer is biased, but in the tradition that I am most familiar with, this reasoning is not so much based in ‚Äúanti-sex views‚Äù as it is based in the simple fact that sex can cause suffering. As a result, learning how not to follow sexual desire can promote non-suffering. Sex/masturbation in layperson life is not always a violation of Buddhist ethics, but it is also not very skillful to just follow the wanting mind wherever it leads your actions. The main reason why sex/masturbation in layperson life can be ‚Äúwrong‚Äù is just that it can easily cause immense suffering both to yourself and others if you are not careful. 

If you want to see some similarities and differences between Buddhist views of sex for laypeople and those for monastics, maybe see these three links:

People then lived more communally, they did not have separate bed  rooms, enclosed showers and all those things that allow the circumstances to be right for masturbation. It is only very recently in western culture that it has become ""the norm"" and people do it all the time without thinking. Try spending a week in a village in Asia and jerking off is just not possible unless you really, really want it. So the Buddha did not talk much about it. But he did warn that sexuality is a dangerous form of sensual craving. It is very strong, and once you indulge in it your mind tend to be more sensually indulgent in general, which is what we want to avoid. So the approach we have is to be a bit careful around sexual indulgence. We have to do it to procreate, and it is a wonderful thing, but because it is so powerful serious practitioners often abstain from it and liberate themselves from the craving of it.","I see it as: Masturbation causes craving, craving causes suffering, masturbation causes suffering.

I used to be addicted to masturbating and it caused depression, anxiety and other mental afflictions. As with all Buddhism, the Buddha isn't watching you over your shoulder, ready to smite you down if you touch your pp. If you think it causes you suffering, don't do it.",,,,,,,,,,

My personal view is that since it is patterned on human behaviour, the predictions have some validity. Coupled with millenia of feedback loop ie self fulfilling prophecy, you'd end up with a prediction system that is reasonably accurate.

Part of the 16 vows we take is from the Dhammapada:

&gt;
&gt; Do good for others

Very simple and intuitive. Less focused on specifics. We intuitively know what's good and what's not good.","Not offensive at all. As if often the case, this bundle of suffering is pointing toward something important.

What you are describing is known as *""clinging to rites and rituals.""* Wikipedia (paraphrasing Thanissaro Bhikkhu) summarizes this well:

&gt;The view that one becomes pure simply through performing rituals (animal sacrifices, ablutions, chanting, etc.) **or adhering to rigid moralism** or relying on a god for non-causal delivery (issara nimmƒÅna).

This clinging supports ‚Äî and is mutually supported ‚Äî by *self view*. You cling to rigid moralism because you are preoccupied with how it affects *who or what you are, have been, or will become* both in terms of worldly relationships and even as a spiritual practitioner. That clinging, in turn, strengthens these preoccupations.

The resulting subsequent mental proliferation and unappealing feelings fuel *doubt*.

All three of these things fuel *suffering*.

The answer to the ""irony"" you describe is not to altogether abandon morality or revert to a deluded state, but to reconsider how ""you"" relate to morality and the path. 

A lot of what you've described is so big in scale. Past karma, future karma, obstacles to great awakening, preparing for that next level, achievement, flawlessness.

May I suggest - it may be possible to try a relationship with Dharma that is a little smaller in scale. Here and now: how is this mind? Can I trace back the conditions ‚Äî inner or outer ‚Äî that gave rise to that quality of mind? As I intend in one way or another, how do the qualities change? As I act in one way or another, how do the qualities change?

Seeing this enough times, our relationship to morality might become a little more natural. There might be a more pragmatic understanding that here and now, a wholesome state gives rise to pleasant experiences, and an unwholesome state gives rise to unpleasant experiences. Virtue might start to bring practice alive, and vice versa.",,,,,,,,,,
311,,Buddhism,"I've just read an interesting book called 'Soka Gakkai‚Äôs Human Revolution: The Rise of a Mimetic Nation in Modern Japan' by Levi McLaughlin about the ever controversial but deeply interesting Soka Gakkai denomination and it really resonated with my thoughts about the way in which I see modern Buddhists interact with society. To set out my perspective, while I am not currently a Buddhist I have a deep interest in the history and practice of Buddhism from an academic/personal standpoint.

When reading about and talking to Buddhists, I find they often belong to one of three 'tribes' or schools of thought about the way their denomination and Buddhism more generally should be organised. There are the Traditionalists  whose first instincts are naturally enough backward looking. They seek to restore an idealised state of Buddhism, utilising the vinaya or existing 'folkways' to maintain purity. There are the Philosophisers, who avoid what they see as the labels and trappings of religion and ultimately aim to abstract Buddhism from dogmatic organisations altogether, which necessitates a somewhat decentralised perspective. Both these groups are interesting to observe but their responses to modern pressures and concerns often feel uninspired, which is why the third group, the Reformers, is so interesting as the solutions they come to are often based in a deep pragmatism above ideology.

I don't think it would be inaccurate to say that SGI represents possibly the most successful and most radical reformation of Buddhism currently existing in the world. Of course, we have to define reformation first before we discuss the matter further, so let us say that from here that a religious reformation is an attempt to adapt both doctrine and organisation to currently existing conditions while still reserving what is seen as the core values. So what does that mean for SG? SG comes from the Nichiren tradition but suffice to say that the historic differences between SG and mainstream Nichiren Buddhism are today far overshadowed by the difference between SG and mainstream Buddhist schools today. It's this difference that McLaughlin highlights when he describes SG as less one religious denomination among others but a 'Mimetic Nation', a shadow state that commands social, political and spiritual obedience to a level unseen elsewhere in Japan and uncommon elsewhere.

McLaughlin sees no parallels in Buddhism for an organisation like SG and few outside Buddhism, with the closest examples in the mega churches of Evangelical Protestantism, with the combination of internal insularity with an outward facing emphasis on conversion. Some look at SG's moderate size at around 8-12 million as proof that their model has a natural ceiling, but just looking at raw numbers can mask deeper truths. Crucially, SG manages to maintain an extraordinarily high number of engaged members. There are few to no 'Christmas and Easter' SG members, especially in Japan. Once you join, expectations are high for participation in every aspect of religious life and beyond. This means purchasing goods from SG affiliated shops, distributing literature, talking to friends and family about SG and voting for the SG approved candidate. Indeed, McLaughlin argues that the main reason SG cannot be called a 'shadow state' is because it would imply that members put the the Japanese nation before the Mimetic nation of SG, which he found to be highly questionable in practice.

Now from the outside this all looks very cult-like and tell all exposes by former members never fail to do well. However, to judge an religious organisation simply by it's detractors would be to condemn all to cult status. In order to move forward, we must remain open to the possibility that SG or at least it's model may have legitimate value. So what are the arguments for the defence? Firstly that what SG does it not at all new, only that it does it better than the organisations that criticise it. As one SG scholar points out, Buddhism was not spread by the Buddha sitting under a tree marinating in his own perfection, it was spread by his preaching and his example. What others might cynically call marketing is simply a modern take on an old practice, a practice which has been set aside by other groups in favour of a comfortable but stagnant quietism. This touches on a nerve that runs throughout modern Buddhism, the role of Buddhism in the world. Some say that 'Political Buddhism' is a perversion of Buddhism. Some say that an apolitical Buddhism is both ahistorical and amoral. While none would claim that engaging in politics is a risk free endeavour, the SG's bold stance of establishing it's own party, Komeito, to support and expand it's influence at least avoids the danger of a weak-hearted equivocation that pleases no-one.

I'm aware that this is a hugely controversial area, which is one of the reasons I'm interested in it, but if comments and discussion could be kept civil, that would be for the best. Thank you for reading!

They've excised the core elements of Buddhism, after all. It's like if a branch of Christianity ditched Jesus, the concept of Sin, and the idea of both Heaven and Hell. Would that even be Christianity anymore? I think most people would be reasonable in saying ""no"".

Likewise, SGI has ditched the Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, and the motivation to escape samsara. Instead they seem to focus on using practices to acquire material wealth in *this* life. What good is that in the context of what the Buddha taught? The whole point of Buddhism is to realize nirvana and, therefore, the end of samsara. SGI has done away with that so, in my opinion, it shouldn't be considered part of Buddhism because it's ditched the Buddhism!

So we can't say it's trying to ""reform"" anything. It's divorced itself from Buddhism and gone on to be something completely separate.","&gt; the solutions they come to are often based in a deep pragmatism above ideology.

I'm curious to hear what solutions SG has come up with the numerous problems sucking the blood of Japanese society if this is addressed in the book. Other than ""just join us"", that is.

&gt; What others might cynically call marketing is simply a modern take on an old practice, a practice which has been set aside by other groups in favour of a comfortable but stagnant quietism.

Buddhism in Japan has, until the Meiji era, always been associated with politics‚Äîusually in the sense that Buddhist institutions have been controlled by imperial power. During the Meiji era, State sponsorship for Buddhism declined and disappeared. After WW2, traditional Buddhist organizations stayed away from trying to form political power bases following the principle of separation of religion and State. ""Quietism"" in this front is less about a failure to innovate but more about respecting the principles of Japanese law *as old as traditional religious institutions*. In the distant past, there have been instances of at least one Buddhist monk trying to take power, and at some point the Tendai school wielded considerable political and military strength. ""Political Buddhism"" isn't anything new to this country.

Furthermore, traditional Japanese Buddhist organizations don't neatly fall into any category you mentioned (traditionalist, philosopher and reformist). The Vinaya doesn't exist here and there's no large-scale movement to abolish the temple inheritance system to funnel only interested recruits into the clergy. Buddhist clergy philosophizing about their form of Buddhism don't argue for the end of sectarian institutions, and they rarely turn it all into an abstract mess. Finally, there's a growing concern (and efforts made) among metropolitan clergy to make Buddhism reconnect with people and show its relevance for modern life, but this has multiple obstacles in front of it both from the inside (the center/periphery opposition within sects) and the outside (the malaise of Japanese society and the still common stigma against ""being religious"").  
Accordingly, what sets SG apart is its complete disconnect from lineage and tradition, as well as the shallowness of its Buddhism. These are the things that allow it to be a ""mimetic nation"" in the first place.

&gt; the SG's bold stance of establishing it's own party, Komeito,

As far as I've seen, nothing about the Komeito is noticeably Buddhist (pike SG itself). Or even particularly different from other center or center-of-right parties in Japan. The party claims that it's now separate from SG anyway. Does the book address how this reflects on the organization today?","I am a lifelong practitioner of Nichiren Buddhism as a member of the Soka Gakkai International (SGI) and I find the practice very helpful and relevant to me in my daily life. I also read Levi McLaughlin's book, and the PhD thesis on which it was a based with great interest. 

Thank you for engaging with the history and practice of Soka Gakkai from an objective and academic perspective, rather than base your opinion on gossip, rumor and hearsay that is very common on the internet. What I like about McLaughlin, as well as other scholars who have studied and research Soka Gakkai and Nichiren Buddhism like Jacqueline Stone, Daniel Metraux and others is that they seek to understanding the Soka Gakkai in terms of its history and philosophy without trying to either celebrate or condemn it. I hope more people do the same, and I am happy that reading this book and thinking about the Soka Gakkai analytically helped you consider Buddhism in the modern world.",,,,,,,,,,

Do only good

Purify the mind 

This is the teaching of the Buddhas


(Paraphrasing the Dhammapada)","In it's *simplest* form (searching for purity is a fool's errand), it is: avoid unwholesome actions; cultivate wholesome actions; purify the mind. This is the popular simple refrain from the Dhammapada and sums up the Buddha's teachings very concisely.","As the main summary (Avoid harmful acts, cultivate wholesome acts, purify the mind.) has been given already, maybe another classic summary statement:

&gt;ye dharmƒÅ hetuprabhavƒÅ hetu·πÉ te·π£ƒÅ·πÉ tathƒÅgato hy avadat te·π£ƒÅ·πÉ ca yo nirodha eva·πÉvƒÅdƒ´ mahƒÅ≈õrama·πáa·∏•

*""Regarding phenomena that arise from causes: their causes have been taught by the Tathagata, as well as their cessation. This the Great Sramana proclaims.""*

More practically, I think it's often sorta the wrong question to ask what the purest form of something is. The purest form of a car might be an engine block with a gas tank, wheels and steering.

There are a number of biographies out there from Thai traditions of arhats that have entered nirvana that may be worth looking into. I'm sure in other traditions too, but I know these Thai biographies are easily accessible in English.

Within my own tradition, we tend to look at relics as evidence of awakening. Thich Tri Quang passed away in 2019 and left behind most of his skull. Thich Quang Duc left behind is heart. Most awakened masters leave behind a few grams' worth of pebble-like relics. Occasionally you'll have mummified masters, called ""whole-body relics."" Thich Nhat Hanh has said he doesn't intend on leaving any relics behind, which is disappointing, though you can also interpret this as him very very subtly acknowledging he's awakened (you could also interpret it as him denying he's awakened).","Ajahn Brahm describes it as the ""highest happiness."" Bliss. Permanent and unconditioned.  He goes into depth about the stages of absorption and bliss in *Mindfulness, Bliss, and Beyond*.","&gt;what does achieving enlightenment feel like

From the Scripture on the Bliss of NirvƒÅ·πáa (preserved in the Sri Lankan Buddhist Canon):

At one time Venerable ≈öƒÅriputra was staying near RƒÅjag·πõha, in the Bamboo Grove, the squirrels‚Äô feeding ground. 

There he addressed the mendicants:
‚ÄúReverends, nirvƒÅ·πáa is bliss!  NirvƒÅ·πáa is bliss!""

When he said this, Venerable UdƒÅyƒ´ said to him, ‚ÄúBut Reverend ≈öƒÅriputra, what‚Äôs blissful about it, since nothing is felt?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThe fact that nothing is felt is precisely what‚Äôs blissful about it.""

-

In an epistle he wrote in verse to the King of ƒÄndhra, the Buddhist philosopher NƒÅgƒÅrjuna said that scratching an itch feels good, but it is better to not have an itch at all. Enlightenment does not feel like anything in particular, but it is peace, because it is the end of those feelings which arise in dependence on negative mental tendencies.

&gt;more people out there than the dalai lama

The Dalai Lama actually has not claimed any attainments. We cannot really say whether or not he is enlightened.

Generally, Buddhist traditions don't tend to regard a person as having been enlightened until after they pass. During their lives, it is somewhat rare for people to be *publically* recognized as enlightened, though they might be recognized within their specific practice communities.

But all of the extant Buddhist traditions have had recently passed people who were regarded as having been enlightened.",,,,,,,,,,

319,,Buddhism,"I was at my son's swimming lesson today and something came to mind that I thought to share.

In a pool that is shallow, say 5 feet deep, there are 'No Diving' signs. 

In general, the main reason for the prohibition on diving is so that someone doesn't dive in, hit the bottom, and break their neck or otherwise get hurt.

The secondary reason is that even if someone is a competent enough swimmer that they might be able to control their body well enough if they dived into shallow water to not hurt themselves, if they were to do so it would demonstrate a bad example for others, and others who are less competent may follow their lead and those less competent swimmers may get injured.

So generally speaking, it's a good prohibition, and one should not dive into the pool.

With that said, hypothetically there could be a situation where someone was seen to be immediately drowning, and time was of the utmost essence.

In such a situation, a competent swimmer - say a trained lifeguard who realized that only they could save the drowning person - might dive into the pool despite the prohibition so as to save the swimmer's life.

In general, I think most would agree that this is an appropriate action.

It still would be a sort of 'infraction', and afterwards it may be reasonable to explain to children, for example, that the only reason that the person broke the rule was because they were a very good swimmer and it was an extraordinary circumstance, and the children should not follow their lead. So in some sense the diver might apologize to the children and explain that the rule is still a good rule, even if the act was appropriate.

When it comes to the Vinaya, there are various levels of rules. There are very few rules which, when the appropriate conditions are met, entail expulsion from the monastic order. There are a number of other rules that, for example, entail confession.

In general, in the Mahayana at times it is explained that [pratimoksha precepts](https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Pratimoksha_vows) may be broken under particular circumstances in which it is truly beneficial to do so, and when the one who breaks them is truly competent.

As to this latter point, for example Jigme Lingpa says (best I can paraphrase without the quote in front of me) that for beginning Bodhisattvas it is of utmost importance to avoid non-virtue so that one's root of practicing the Dharma is not severed.

Similarly, Patrul Rinpoche says,

&gt;If you are a beginner, the main thing is to protect yourself from harm. Like the shoot of a medicinal plant, protecting yourself from harm will be the source of benefit to others.

With that said, if one is truly in control of one's mind and would not be destroyed by breaking a precept, and if it is truly beneficial to do so, then it may be done.

Even so, it may entail 'confession', similar to the diver apologizing to the children for his/her infraction.

But nonetheless, it is still a virtuous action to break the precept in general, provided that the qualifications are met in that the individual is actually qualified to do so and it is truly beneficial.

Of note, I would argue that this message is implicit in the Velama Sutta as well in the Pali Canon, where it says that the merit of even a whiff of goodwill is a superior merit to holding the precepts.

Of note, for the most part, if we take the example of the competent diver, it is indeed generally a good idea to not dive in the pool, even if one would do so under extraordinary circumstances. Similarly, it may generally be a most excellent idea to hold the precepts without breaking them, even if one would do so under extraordinary circumstances. That is, the 'whiff of goodwill' and 'holding the precepts' are not incompatible enemies where it is one vs the other - in most/many circumstances they may be quite significantly in harmony with each other. If that is the case, it is appropriate to not just 'pick the higher virtue' but rather do both.

I will point out, for clarity, that in this conversation, none of it relates to simple carelessness. This discussion is not about justification for being lazy and dismissing the importance of the pratimoksha level of precepts. It is about recognizing different layers of virtue, as well as the purpose of prohibitions, basically, when it comes to pratimoksha level vows.

&gt;In the context of actions to be abandoned, there is a further distinction separating the pratimoksha from the bodhisattva vows. Having in mind self-interested persons who have taken the vows and who apprehend phenomena as truly existent, the Buddha did not allow (in a pratimoksha context) the seven aforesaid negative actions of body and speech to be perpetrated, even in situations in which
others might benefit. The precepts as formulated are not to be transgressed. Bodhisattvas, however, are permitted to disregard them
if this would be of benefit to others. In this situation, an examination must be made to see whether three conditions are present. First, the
Bodhisattva must know that a given negative action (i.e., one of the seven, physical or verbal) is of direct benefit to others, and, second, that it will be so in future. Finally, the Bodhisattva must be sure that such an action will not obstruct the accumulation of merit but will rather augment it. These three conditions being present, the
Bodhisattva is allowed to act in an apparently negative way. This is illustrated in the story of Captain Goodheart, who killed Black
Spearman in order to protect him from the full ripening of his actions and thereby perfected the accumulation of merits of eighty thousand
kalpas. Then there was Tararamana, the son of the Brahmin, who practiced chastity in the forest for forty-two thousand years. One day,
he went to a village to beg for alms and was seen by the daughter of a merchant, who fell violently in love with him. She became so infatuated that she was ready to kill herself. In order to prevent this, the ascetic relinquished his vow of chastity and in this way accumulated the merit of eighty thousand kalpas. Other stories can be found that give similar examples of stealing and so forth. In the case of the four negative actions of speech, if those actions are truly meaningful, the Bodhisattva is allowed to perform them. They may have the appearance of faults, but they are in fact virtues. However, given that it is the intention that creates the powerful effect of an
action, it stands to reason that the three negative actions of mind are not permitted to anyone under any circumstances. 

&gt;Therefore, within the context of the Mahayana, the seven negative actions of body and speech are (under certain circumstances) permitted. It is said in the teachings, however, that in the case of
someone new to the bodhisattva commitment, who is still involved in his or her own concerns and desire for happiness, and who gives up
the precepts because they are difficult to keep and not through any intention to bring direct or indirect benefit to others, the perpetration of all such actions is simply a downfall.

Rinpoche continues:

&gt;Thus, for the beginner on the bodhisattva path, the first task is to discipline the mind. The most important thing is to train oneself in such a way that qualities like renunciation and faith constantly increase. Beginners must train to bring their minds under control, progressing steadily day by day and month by month. Indeed, if at the outset, when the mind has not yet been purified by the discipline of avoiding negative behavior, too much emphasis is placed on the other two aspects of the bodhisattva discipline (namely, undertaking positive actions and bringing benefit to others), many hindrances will occur that impede progress in the three trainings, the path to buddhahood.",,,,,,,,,,,

The statement is that if he admitted women into the sangha, the *brahmacarya* will not last. This is translated into ""the holy life."" And it's usually used as a euphemism for religious practices of chastity. So in the first usage of this, it's pretty clear (in the context it was spoken) to refer to the women's practice of chastity--he's afraid they'll get raped in the woods, and he doesn't want his step-mother to experience that danger, so he encourages her to practice a sort of semi-monasticism at home.

In the second and third iterations of him repeating this, the language gets changed, and this is where Analayo has shown this to be a later revision, and a false interpretation of ""brahmacarya"" as referring to the duration of the Buddhasasana, which is not a common association.

The golden rule is common to many religions and philosophies and I think that the way it's learned can influence our actions and attempts at being good to others.

When I lived in the States I heard for the first time ""do unto others..."" and it explained so much because it just didn't translate right into Spanish or Galician (my mother tongues). There's a push to act and force your ideas onto others there (in the ""DO"" form) whereas in the negative form ""don't do unto others..."" the idea is closer to ""live and let live"". Our (and this is true for my own upbringing, I'm not speaking for my country or my community) positive form is ""treat others..."" which doesn't sound as enforcing as ""do"".

She felt the duty to save me because that's what she would like someone else to do if she had been in my shoes. 

If the language used gives it a ring of absoluteness, it's difficult to contemplate anything outside of that ""all or nothing"" point of view.

Notes

1. The Commentary states that AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çika is here referring to alms that he gives to the poor; his alms to the Sangha remained of high quality. However, it might have been that this discourse took place during a time of famine, when even AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çika was reduced to giving only the coarse food both to the Sangha and to the poor. If that is the case, then we can read the Buddha's remarks to AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çika as reassuring him that in straitened circumstances it is still fruitful to give, even when one can only give coarse things. The merit of the gift is determined more by the state of mind with which it is given than by the external quality of the gift.

&lt;p&gt;On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near SƒÅvatthƒ´ in Jeta&amp;#39;s Grove, AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çika&amp;#39;s monastery. Then AnƒÅthapi·πá·∏çika the householder went to the Blessed One and, on arrival, bowed down to him and sat to one side. As he was sitting there, the Blessed One said to him, &amp;quot;Householder, are gifts still given in your family?&amp;quot;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gifts are still given in my family, lord, but they are coarse: broken rice cooked with bran, accompanied by pickle brine.&amp;quot;&lt;a href=""https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an09/an09.020.than.html#fn-1""&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

No. The owner is in wrong livelihood. A simple checkout clerk is not the one selling the alcohol. The clerk is making a living operating a register and operating a register is not ""trading in intoxicants"", it's just operating a register. 

[Bhikkhu Pesala comments:](https://www.dhammawheel.com/viewtopic.php?p=237536#p237536)
&gt; Working in a shop or supermarket that sells meat is not included. Why? Because the staff are not selling the meat, they are only filling shelves, or working on the checkout. The supermarket owners or shop-keepers are the ones who are buying the meat for resale. Likewise, if one is asked to work on the wine counter, and is serving customers who ask for wine, spirits, or beer, then one is not ""trading in intoxicants.""
&gt;     
&gt;However, if one is working on a commission, or if one owns a corner shop that sells intoxicants or meat, then one is trading in and profiting from the sale of intoxicants or meat.","When I moved to a different city, one of the first places to offer me a job was a convenience store/pharmacy. On my first day I began to feel weird about selling cigarettes and lottery tickets because, to me, people come to a pharmacy for medicine to get well and stay healthy. It seemed like a contradiction in values to therefore offer things that are poisonous and harmful to people, to help them hurt themselves.

At the end of my first shift I decided that wasn't for me, so I thanked the manager for giving me a chance and I decided to part ways. For me, that was the right choice and I'm glad I listened to my intuition and followed my heart instead of trying to rationalize or silence what I felt about it.",This is not wrong livelihood.

Once you have some help and a support structure around you, try exploring the dharma but going at it alone and looking for it to fix on a forum is not recommended in my humble opinion.

This is not to you OP, This forum needs better moderation. I have seen too many people suffering from severe mental illness coming here asking for help with Buddhist practice or advice and people replying with ‚ÄúBuddhist‚Äù advice rather than pointing the OPs to medical resources.","You remind me a bit of myself at your age. Be careful with understanding the difference between physical action and what happens in the mind with these practices. One monk explained celibacy as a natural letting go of craving, by understanding the truth of the body that lust craves and grasps at. It should be a peaceful letting go, something that just feels natural.  On the other hand, a lot of western monks who ordain when 20+years old tend to force an adjustment. This is more like mentally they are pulling back a rubber band. Through aversion and forced actions they are mentally surprising desire and that only leads to a breaking point where the rubber band snaps back and propelled the craving further.  These people tend to fall off the wagon of their practice and then reset and do the same suppressed behavior again and again till they burn out and give up.
As for dealing with celibacy or just masturbation cravings, there are some practices that can help. First know that lustful desire is one of the hardest to get over, so it will take a lot of time and patience. Don't feel bad if you give in to temptation.  For myself, in my forties it took about 2 years to really feel comfortable being celibate and letting go of craving.
Now, with that, when desire does arise try to take a mental inventory of what's going on in your life.  This is learning what things trigger the reaction to masterbate. Sometimes it's seeing a sexy movie scene, sometimes it's stress, sometimes it's just boredom, only you'll know what creates the conditions to want to masturbate for you.
Then next is to start to tackle these conditions. If it's stress then look at why the fantasy in masturbation is an escape. What are you escaping from? What are you escaping into?

For the fantasy of escaping into the desire thoughts, one good technique monks use is to stop the fantasy and just analyze the physical body involved in your desire.  Look at the skin, the hair, the eyes, the shape.  What part are you desiring? Then break it down further. The skin you crave to touch is only pleasurable because of the tissue, muscle and blood underneath. Which part do you crave? Which cell, molecule, atom? If you crave a certain body part, you could even look at anatomy books to reassociate your relationship with that body part.  The goal here is to see physical bodies for what they are, not what you project in to them.

I'd recommend you find a local sangha to also talk to.  Usually there's a teacher who you can ask about desire and how to deal with it. They can help you step into this gradually.

Lastly, you're also 19. Hormones/libido at this age, and through your twenties, will be a big part of life. So don't get discouraged as it might not all be within your control.","Start with developing a habit of daily sitting meditation for at least 30 minutes each day if you haven't. It's very important to have some experience with meditation before even thinking about retreats. 

Then you can try the 10 day Vipassana retreats which are offered in many places in US for free. You will just have to arrange for commute. 

Retreats aren't really for quick fixes in life though. You may still not be free from addiction after these retreats but they will help you strengthen your daily practice which will enhance your life in every way.",,,,,,,,,,

I'm a spiritual person who has recently become fascinated with buddhist teachings. 

One thing I'm confused about is hell. I know that the basics are if your bad karma outweighs the good that you go to a hell. If the opposite you go to a heaven. Neither is permanent, but they are very long experiences.

But I've also read that ""hell"" is any place that is full of suffering, and not neccesarily a realm of torture for burning up bad karma.

Is hell a place? Do you actually get frozen/burned/tortured in these realms? Or is it symbolism for reincarnation into a lower being? Are there differing beliefs on this in different traditions?

but most of all, will we all inevitably spend time in hell unless we reach nirvana? because I've read that the curse of heaven is not knowing of the bad, and thus not being able to build good karma, and then falling to hell to use up your leftover karma from your time in the human realm before reincarnating. And if we do, will it be as bad as going straight to hell from your life as a human who has done wrong?

Metaphorically speaking, we might say that. But absent metaphor, hell refers to the experience of hell beings, who are those class of sentient beings experiencing themselves getting frozen, burned, etc.

&gt;Is hell a place

Buddhist traditions regard it to be a place in the same way that you are in a place right now, but how Buddhists traditions regard that second statement differs. I think that the Buddhist philosopher Vasubandhu makes a very compelling argument for hell being a kind of mass hallucination of the hell beings, where ""hell beings"" is simply a class of sentient being. Them hallucinating themselves getting tortured is a result of the conditioning of their minds due to their karma. However, Vasubandhu also thinks that *this* experience is a collective hallucination of ""human beings"" as well, because he doesn't believe in extramental objects at all. I'll let you decide how you feel about that.

&gt;Or is it symbolism for reincarnation into a lower being

It isn't ""symbolism"" for reincarnation into a lower being...it *is* reincarnation into a lower being: a hell being, which is a kind of being whose worldly experience is characterized by torture and inhospitability.

&gt;but most of all, will we all inevitably spend time in hell unless we reach nirvana? because I've read that the curse of heaven is not knowing of the bad, and thus not being able to build good karma, and then falling to hell to use up your leftover karma from your time in the human realm before reincarnating. And if we do, will it be as bad as going straight to hell from your life as a human who has done wrong?

This is what I've been taught, but I also know of scriptures which involve some beings in heaven who actually do manage to apply the Dharma, so presumably it isn't a *guarantee* that a deva is going to go to hell afterwards. It just happens a lot.

&gt;The concept of a hell really intimidates me and is kind of turning me away from the teachings

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/khantipalo/wheel271.html

The other contributor to your infatuation is your loneliness. To meet that need, practice loving kindness mindfulness regularly. 

Between developing these two bases of mindfulness, you should be able to let go out your infatuations.

The greater delusion driving us all is the notion that love, sex, human companionship, can fulfil us in a lasting permanent way. There is no conditioned thing in this world that can satisfy us in this way. This kind is harder to let go of, and is really the essence of the path.

The Buddha's original teaching on loving kindness is here:

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/snp/snp.1.08.amar.html","&gt; I am addicted to sex and I am always thinking about how much I want to have a beautiful girlfriend or something akin to that. I become infatuated with women very easily and cannot seem to get over them,

This isn't addiction to sex. It's rumination and an inability to move on.

&gt; I believe that I feel this way because I am so very lonely and part of me has fallen victim to the ideology that if I have a beautiful partner or if I can have a lot of sex then I won't feel lonely anymore.

Have your ever had a relationship?

Do you do meaningful activities in your life? Do you have friends?

It's common for people to try bypassing lifestyle problems with spirituality and Buddhism, but that usually doesn't work very well. Looking at corpses is not going to be a solution here. There's no magic bullet solution, in fact, and you'll have to identify what exactly is it that you need to address first and work on it through your practice.",,,,,,,,,,

For a more elaborate analysis, you could study the twelve links of dependent origination.","It is craving for existence, non-existence, and sensory experience that results in clinging to the conceit of Self, and it is this clinging that serves as fuel for the process of Becoming. When clinging to Self has been completely severed, actions become contextualized only through the causes and conditions leading to their arising, and are karmically neutral because there is no intention imbued with self-grasping behind the actions. Actions at that point are simply the natural effortless conduct that result from the soup of causality.

In zen traditions, we borrow the term ""wuwei"" (or ""vo vi"" in Vietnamese) from Taoism to describe effortless awakened conduct, and I think this illustration of ""inactive action"" may be helpful in understanding why awakened beings' conduct is not karmically potent.","It has to do with the 4 noble truths, including the 4th truth -- the Noble Eightfold Path.

Ignorance is the ultimate cause of rebirth. The replacement of ignorance with wisdom is the cause of awakening. Through learning the Buddha's teachings, ignorance weakens, wisdom strengthens.

The Noble Eightfold Path is the cessation of karma.

You have to learn about the Buddha's teaching about Dependent Origination to understand the context. A Buddha has eyes, ears, and the other senses just like us. But when contact is made, we think these things are more real than they are. The Buddha makes contact between the eye and the object, but knows whatever feeling arises is not his. Through this wisdom, the pursuant craving cannot arise. But for the unawakened, when contact is made between the eye and object, a feeling arises and is possessed, so craving then arises and is possessed. This then leads to suffering as dictated by the 4 noble truths, particularly the first two that deal with dukkha (what it is) and it's cause.",,,,,,,,,,

It takes a tremendous amount of practice to even shake loose a little bit of that habit, to experience anything at all just as it is, without any act of mental imputation onto the experience.","My therapist (who is a Buddhist and very smart man imo) explains mindfulness in a way that really speaks to me. He says ‚Äúmindfulness isn‚Äôt about being present. Mindfulness is about training yourself to detach when you realize you are dwelling on something‚Äù. And I very much agree with that statement. To me, it makes sense because most of our life has been spent with our mind caught up in labels, worrying, dwelling on concepts, searching for external things that we think might finally bring us ‚Äúhappiness‚Äù, etc etc. And there‚Äôs really no way that I can argue against that, because it is demonstrated to be completely true by MY experience. In fact, the vast majority of my time while I‚Äôve been here on this earth (in this life one might say), has been spent with this dark cloud of dwelling, rumination, pain, and ESPECIALLY failed attempts to become fully satisfied. And people I talk to often say they‚Äôre going through the same things (to different degrees and with different nuances of course). My point is, we‚Äôve been very conditioned to be the opposite of mindful... we‚Äôve had soooo much more practice and experience being caught up in semantics. So of course, it‚Äôs going to take a good amount of effort and time to begin to break these habits, let alone be fully or even mostly free of them. Mindfulness is indeed work.

That being said, I believe being ‚Äúpresent‚Äù is really a sense of satisfaction that begins to arise and heighten as a RESULT of being mindful. And there is no denying that it is an extremely pleasant, freeing feeling. I experience it often when meditating or just paying attention even. The fact that you have this is great! It means you‚Äôve been putting in effort toward mindfulness. This is like a little token of your success. Sink into it... it‚Äôs encouraged! As long as you don‚Äôt become wrapped up in thought and craving surrounding the relief (which happens a lot in my experience), you‚Äôre golden. And if you do start to get caught up in a reframed type of craving, what do you do? You do exactly what you‚Äôve already been doing. You detach from the involvement in it, and you lightly place your attention back where you determined you would put it. This is truly the beauty of mindfulness, at least in my eyes!","How long does that fresh feeling last after the breeze is gone?

No, it doesn't. I would be floored if you could without years of diligent practice.

Knowing the cause of suffering is the result of following the path, not the path itself. The path itself is training the mind through virtue, generosity, meditation and investigation. Nobody finds the answers to the biggest questions in life after a few tries. It's a lifelong path with plenty of rewards along the way.","I mean this is the basis of the four noble truths, especially the 2nd and 3rd. 

Second Truth: What causes suffering?Delusion, greed, and aversion, the three poisons, are the seeds of suffering. They are made of the Worldly Dhammas: Gain and Loss, Pleasure and Pain, Fame and Disrepute, Praise and Blame.

Third Truth: How to end suffering? By realizing the Worldly Dharmas as impermanent, attaching to them causing suffering, and only through renunciation we can let go of these views, especially identity-view.

How do you renounce?
I mean you can sit down and see it right now. Look at your mind and see how impermanent it all is. And when I mean look, I mean actually see everything the mind produces. 

Forms (beautiful to ugliness, ugliness to beautiful).
Sensations (cold to warm, warm to cold). Perceptions (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral), Consciousness (How the mind is always thinking, never seeming to focus on one thing)
Kamma (How the mind wants to do things for the sake of good or bad intentions). Notice how the 5 skandhas are related in relation to the three poisons.

Once you renounce all of these things as what they are, impermanent, you will experience temporary emptiness and gained right view. Thus you are now able to walk the path if you have the resolve to do so. (Fourth Noble Truth)

I don't get why people like to skip steps and head to 8-Fold Path right away. If you don't have right view which is only gained through the third noble truth, everything else is wrong.  Your wisdom, virtue, and even concentration, will be wrong due to it's connection of the worldly dhammas.","You have to realize some of the roots are from past lives, eg. You are infatuated with this person for no apparent reasons.  You just need to acknowledge this, it should be enough.  There is no way you could eliminate the cause of this event because it has already happened in the past,  but you can still eliminate your sufferings by not not reacting to it. 

Practisioners are trained to work on their sixth consciousness to not attach/react to external forces by realizing both your senses and the external world are empty.  You may need to attain stream entry in order to do this though.",,,,,,,,,,

One might argue (should one give a hoot to begin with) that that in itself is somewhat distasteful.

But! You seem to accord this object some more profound meaning than just seeing it as something that goes with the throw pillows. You don't need to be (or become) a Buddhist to appreciate the Buddha. Nor do you need to be a Buddhist for me (arguably a Buddhist) to appreciate your appreciation of the Buddha. 

Generally, being offended at other people's actions and motivations isn't really something that's part of Buddhist practice. But, I think that generally speaking, Buddhists will dig your respectfulness in asking here and be happy that you're not just appropriating the Buddha and Buddhism for whatever your own ideas and feelings are (which is a somewhat popular pastime in certain circles).

I watched his video ""Dealing with Regret""

I am still having problems with regret. He talks about how regret is the result of knowing you did something unskillful in the past. But he talks about how it is good that you have learned from the regret. It was somewhat comforting to hear this. 

I'm still having a problem with regret because its hard to accept and come to terms that my past unskillful actions are affecting me everyday now. I wish I had been more skillful in undergrad in school, in dieting, in social skills, in dating. And its hard to come to terms with regret knowing that the effects of past unskillful actions continue to affect me now and may impact the rest of my life considerably. 

**What thoughts might you tell yourself in response to regretful thoughts like the below?**

1. ""The damage from past mistakes may not be recoverable""

2. ""You made big mistakes in social skills and dating you'll never get your 20s back, that decade of your life interacting with younger people""

3. ""The uncertainty and pain ahead from past mistakes make this life too frightening and stressful""  

4. ""For some mistakes there was enough information in those past situations for you to have prevented that mistake if you had been more cognizant of XYZ""

Regret is only the first step in addressing past actions that were mistaken.

Following the generation of regret comes: taking Refuge in the Triple Gem, re-establishing the right attitude which sometimes takes the form of making a vow not to repeat the action (this means you're free from future instances of doing that thing again, which should feel pretty good), and finally taking remedial action if possible and if it's not possible then doing some kind of spiritual purification.

If you never move beyond regret, then it's not serving you and you're not really making progress on the path. Regret should be transformed into fuel for the path.","Regret is merely another form of anger. You deal with regret in the same way you deal with anger: loving kindness, compassion, and wisdom.

Give loving kindness to yourself, cheer yourself up when you are down. Show compassion and patient with yourself, know that you did the best you could given the circumstances. Bring wisdom, and see the truth of the matter: undergrad life really has little bearing on adult life, and whatever was done in the past is nothing more than that and nothing can be done about it, but in the present we have a choice to change our future, and ruminating on our mistakes will only set us up for more mistakes.","I think too deal effectively with regret, we also need to accept our limitations and have realistic expectations.

There's taking refuge *formally*, as in doing it ritually. In that case, you'll be taking Refuge with a teacher, monastic, what have you, and that person will have a tradition, and perform the ritual to some degree according to that tradition. 

But: regarding Refuge I'd say the most important and crucial aspect of it is our attitude. If we feel deep trust in the Buddha, the dharma and the sangha, we have taken refuge, regardless of whether we did a ritual or not. 

Moreover: doing the ritual in one tradition doesn't preclude us practicing in other traditions later on. 

In general, I'd say we shouldn't *pick* a tradition at all. Continue investigating and trying things out until you fall in love (so to speak). I don't practice in my tradition because it ""seemed like a good idea."" When I met my teachers, after a while I found I simply *could not disregard* their instruction and guidance. It's a bit like finding out where you belonged all along.

And even that doesn't preclude belonging somewhere else too, later along for example. I don't advocate vacillation of course, but sometimes you'll find that one teacher or style of practice was perfectly the right thing for you for a while, but that it's nonetheless now the right thing to move on to somewhere else. As long as we're not merely indulging our selfishness or trying to avoid Real Deep Change‚Ñ¢, that could be alright. Nothing is fixed, in any context. 

Just some thoughts.","No. Actual refuge is a mental action of taking refuge in the Buddha, dharma and sangha. The Buddha is obviously the Buddha and the dharma and sangha is shared across all Buddhist traditions.

The actual ritual is done in a particular tradition but just the ritual is not the actual act of taking refuge.",,,,,,,,,,,

What's the alternative exactly? The fact is that we exist as sentient beings, as humans in this time and this place, and the conditions we find ourselves in must be responded to. Giving up on work or schooling or maintaining certain social relations that may not be all that pleasant but necessary for some life function somewhere... this can only make your life *more* stressful, less easy.

It would be *great* if we could only pursue the things we value in the here and now, the things that we find fulfilling. I'd love for that world to exist. But it's not the world we find ourselves in. It seems to me that the path of least resistance is playing the role in this society we find ourselves in. If the conditions are hospitable to leaving home, donning the triple robe and shaving one's head, that is wonderful! Many people are not so lucky. But to be in that position requires a number of fortunate circumstances and conditions.

In my youth, I pursued passion. And lived in poverty. And it was very much unpleasant. I don't know if it was worth it, honestly. I don't necessarily have regrets, but my perspective has changed a lot, because I realize... toughing it out at a job you're not super enthused about, for the sake of security, gives you the freedom to pursue your passions. The passion doesn't go away because of the ritual performance our culture demands of us, but existence itself is actually a lot easier.

So the least amount of effort and struggle possible, I think, is in observing these social rituals. They really suck sometimes, but life is so so much harder when you shun it. We have to learn to live with the world we have. We can fight for the world we want, but in the here and now, to avoid suffering, we have to learn to live with the world as it exists around us.","Good question!

Maybe you're beginning to give rise to renunciation, reevaluating your priorities, and trying to figure out what's worth striving for. This is also called *samvega*, or in my tradition ‡Ω¶‡æê‡æ±‡Ωº‡ºã‡Ω§‡Ω∫‡Ω¶‡ºã, *skyo shes*, which you could translate as ""revulsion"". *""What the hell am I even doing with my life?""*

This is not a time for rash decisions, but it is good to investigate yourself and your motivations, and see what it is that you find meaningful. It is of course not the only path, or the best path for everybody, but you could consider looking into becoming a renunciate monastic. 

If that doesn't seem right, you could also look into what kind of work you want to do and why. You could maybe consider keeping a simple job and not focusing on chasing a career living as simply as possible, and dedicate your time to practicing dharma. 

Or you could also become a doctor and spend your time and energy helping people, for the sake of helping them.

In general, I don't think it's a bad thing to find out we're losing the energy and inclination to pour ourselves into worldly concerns. Honestly, many of the things that our culture presents to us as good and worthwhile and meaningful are pretty toxic, IMHO. 

Just some thoughts.","Maybe helpful

It is possible, but one might question the usefulness of such a thing. If one trusts the Buddha and takes the Buddha to be wise and to have knowledge of what should be taken up and set aside to live a good life, then it would probably be best to follow the Buddha's instructions. But I think the only way to feel assured that one is doing so is to practice within a tradition, because a tradition is both a lineage that claims to have preserved the Buddha's instructions but also is a lineage of people who *genuinely accessed the fruit of following those instructions*. Immersing oneself in such a tradition, wherein one can look back in history and see those figures who truly achieved what the Buddha said is possible with a human life, allows one to gain confidence.

&gt;How have some of you gotten into Buddhism

Well at first I just read about it and it seemed compelling, and I tried learning to meditate by myself but found it hard, and I tried adopting certain liturgies alone but it seemed contrived. So I visited a nearby Buddhist temple and started practicing with that community, and I still do practice with them. During the pandemic I got involved with some online practice communities.

&gt;not sure if I can overcome my personal feelings about religion

If you find that you are in the end unable, that is okay. You don't have to be a Buddhist if Buddhism is not amenable to you. The Buddha actually is recorded as having offered advice on various occasions to people who weren't Buddhists, and while in most of those cases the people were so impressed that they ended up converting, I doubt the Buddha only offered said advice purely because he expected them to convert. So one can take the advice of Buddhists under consideration without becoming a Buddhist oneself, and if that brings benefit, that is good.","Try the study guides on accesstoinsight.org

I got into buddhism sorta the same way as you. For me it was anger issues. It took ten years before I called myself a buddhist.

The most important distinction to make early on is between laity and monastics. 

Try to read ""the buddhist layman"" on accesstoinsight.org. Many newbs get lost in the strict teachings, including myself. It made a world of difference to me, when I realized the existence of teachings specifically for laity. 

""The Buddhist Layman"" does unfortunately not really cite sources, but it is all taken from the teachings. Except the part about premarital sex, which the teachings do not deal with at all. 

Suttas for laity are:

This solo practitioner thing is nice, modern and all, but we should be practicing with a monk/sangha and they show us the next steps.","Follow the five precepts and engage in meditation practice.

It's the difference between looking at paintings, and actually learning how to paint.","&gt;""The Buddha's teachings are infused with this notion of gradual development. His method of 'gradual instruction' *(anupubbi-katha)*, which appears in various forms in countless suttas, always follows the same arc: he guides newcomers from first principles through progressively more advanced teachings, all the way to the fulfillment of the Four Noble Truths and the full realization of [nibbana](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca3/nibbana.html):

*Then the Blessed One, having encompassed the awareness of the entire assembly with his awareness, asked himself, ""Now who here is capable of understanding the Dhamma?"" He saw Suppabuddha the leper sitting in the assembly, and on seeing him the thought occurred to him, ""This person here is capable of understanding the Dhamma."" So, aiming at Suppabuddha the leper, he gave a step-by-step talk, i.e., a talk on* [*giving*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/dana/index.html)*, a talk on* [*virtue*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/sila/index.html)*, a talk on* [*heaven*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/sagga/index.html)*; he declared the* [*drawbacks, degradation, &amp; corruption of sensual passions*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/adinava/index.html)*, and the rewards of* [*renunciation*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/nekkhamma/index.html)*. Then when he saw that Suppabuddha the leper's mind was ready, malleable, free from hindrances, elated, &amp; bright, he then gave the Dhamma-talk peculiar to Awakened Ones, i.e.,* [*stress, origination, cessation, &amp; path*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/sacca/index.html)*. And just as a clean cloth, free of stains, would properly absorb a dye, in the same way, as Suppabuddha the leper was sitting in that very seat, the dustless, stainless Dhamma eye arose within him, ""Whatever is subject to origination is all subject to cessation.""*

*‚Äî* [*Ud 5.3*](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.5.03.than.html)

&gt;At each stage of this ""gradual training"" *(anupubbi-sikkha)*, the practitioner discovers a new and important dimension of the law of cause-and-effect ‚Äî [kamma](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/samma-ditthi/kamma.html), the cornerstone of [Right View](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/samma-ditthi/index.html). It is thus a very useful organizing framework with which to view the entirety of the Buddha's teachings.  
&gt;  
&gt;The gradual training begins with the practice of [generosity](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/dana/index.html), which helps begin the long process of weakening the unawakened practitioner's habitual tendencies to cling ‚Äî to views, to sensuality, and to unskillful modes of thought and behavior. This is followed by the development of [virtue](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/sila/index.html), the basic level of sense-restraint that helps the practitioner develop a healthy and trustworthy sense of self. The peace of mind born from this level of self-respect provides the foundation for all further progress along the path. The practitioner now understands that some kinds of happiness are deeper and more dependable than anything that sense-gratification can ever provide; the happiness born of generosity and virtue can even lead to rebirth in [heaven](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/sagga/index.html) ‚Äî either literal or metaphorical. But eventually the practitioner begins to recognize the intrinsic [drawbacks](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/adinava/index.html) of even this kind of happiness: as good as rebirth in wholesome states may be, the happiness it brings is not a true and lasting one, for it relies on conditions over which he or she ultimately has no control. This marks a crucial turning point in the training, when the practitioner begins to grasp that true happiness will never be found in the realm of the physical and sensual world. The only possible route to an unconditioned happiness lies in [renunciation](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/nekkhamma/index.html), in turning away from the sensual realm, by trading the familiar, lower forms of happiness for something far more rewarding and noble. Now, at last, the practitioner is ripe to receive the teachings on the [Four Noble Truths](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/sacca/index.html), which spell out the course of mental training required to realize the highest happiness: [nibbana](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca3/nibbana.html).  
&gt;  
&gt;Many Westerners first encounter the Buddha's teachings on meditation retreats, which typically begin with instructions in how to develop the skillful qualities of [right mindfulness](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/samma-sati/index.html) and [right concentration](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/ati/ptf/dhamma/sacca/sacca4/samma-samadhi/index.html). It is worth noting that, as important as these qualities are, the Buddha placed them towards the very *end* of his gradual course of training. The meaning is clear: to reap the most benefit from meditation practice, to bring to full maturity *all* the qualities needed for Awakening, the fundamental groundwork must not be overlooked. There is no short-cutting this process.""

362,,Buddhism,"Hey everyone, I'm in a bit of a somber mood. I'm 22 and hoping to get some advice. I have a hard time with letting go, but also understand clinging is what causes pain. 

To some extent, I understand I have no choice but to one day lose everything I hold dear. This is the world I was born into, this is the world I will leave. All is transient. There is nothing to hold onto. 

One day I will have to see my parents off, not knowing if I will ever see them again. One day I will have to watch my partner die, or die in front of them. I would like to believe I will see them again, I would like to believe I will be again. No one can say though. 

Knowing this blow will come, knowing my mother will one day leave me here alone. I just can't handle that. I don't think anyone can really teach you how to handle it. But I want to put some tools in my tool-box to at least make the transition easier. 

I often hear that I just need to ""let go"", but this advice seems impossible. I try to let go in the everyday. I do a lot of stoic exercises about acceptance of death and mortality.

I&amp;#39;m 22 and hoping to get some advice. I have a hard time with letting go, but also understand clinging is what causes pain. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To some extent, I understand I have no choice but to one day lose everything I hold dear. This is the world I was born into, this is the world I will leave. All is transient. There is nothing to hold onto. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One day I will have to see my parents off, not knowing if I will ever see them again. One day I will have to watch my partner die, or die in front of them. I would like to believe I will see them again, I would like to believe I will be again. No one can say though. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Knowing this blow will come, knowing my mother will one day leave me here alone. I just can&amp;#39;t handle that. I don&amp;#39;t think anyone can really teach you how to handle it. But I want to put some tools in my tool-box to at least make the transition easier. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often hear that I just need to &amp;quot;let go&amp;quot;, but this advice seems impossible. I try to let go in the everyday. I do a lot of stoic exercises about acceptance of death and mortality. I also try very hard to live my best life, constantly calling my family. Trying to learn more about my parents so I can pass the torch on for them one day.&lt;/p&gt;

It's the complete opposite of forcing/trying. One lets go by seeing clearly something isn't worth clinging to. I'd recommend getting yourself a teacher and practicing Vipassana meditation. I'd recommend Yuttadhammo Bhikku's youtube channel, and you can figure out how to take an at-home meditation course (maybe even do a retreat if you are in Canada). Retreats are incredible for these sorts of worries. But failing / before that (it's a pretty big step) practicing at home is your best bet.

Yep. ‚ÄúLaughing Buddha‚Äù or his real name Budai is generally considered by some Buddhists (mostly Chan) to be one manifestation of the bodhisattva Maitreya, who is going to be the successor of the current Buddha when the Dharma has been forgotten in this world.

If it is possible. Maybe it's not possible, and maybe it's just my ego, with all its attachments, looking for a way to hold on. Any attachment to the world is illusory, and temporary, and can therefore only lead sooner or later to suffering and/or dissatisfaction (dukkha).

&gt;Seek no intimacy with the beloved and also not with the unloved, for not to see the beloved and to see the unloved, both are painful.

&amp;#x200B;

I often receive the answer that, up to a certain point, the two are reconcilable, but this answer has always left me hungry: if, ultimately, romantic love is an attachment and we have to be attached to nothing to be holy, it is difficult to love fully knowing this. It is just as difficult to love fully when you know that personalities are illusory and mortal (anatta).

How can we say that we love each other more than anything else, forever? When we know that this love is illusory and that it will not last? That would be knowingly lying to oneself.

I am also told that one can love without being tied: yes, it is the compassion of the saints, indiscriminate love, which encompasses everything and does not judge. But this indiscriminate love is almost the opposite of romantic love. To love romantically is to want the other for oneself, it is to disappear in him or her, it is to discriminate by placing him or her above the rest, is to want it to last forever. The problem therefore remains.

Metaphysics is a bit cruel, by denying the ultimate reality of personalities (anatta) it does not leave much room other than relative to romantic love.

&gt;if, ultimately, romantic love is an attachment and we have to be attached to nothing to be holy, it is difficult to love fully knowing this

Perhaps it means that I won't be completely and totally holy by the end of this life, but that doesn't mean I can't make real and good progress.","I share your predicament. I was confused about this at one time.  If you agree that ultimate love is pure and contains no attachment, then any other style of love is a deviation from that. 

If we‚Äôre not fully committed to reaching 100% pure love, we can definitely have 98, 95, 80% and still enjoy it pretty well. 

I love my wife and I know it‚Äôs not at 100% pure, but she‚Äôs definitely at the maximum rate at which I can achieve as a normal human engaging in romantic love. Romantic love is mixed with other needs and desires so it can never be 100% pure. 

Words have limitations in expressing reality. Some words can not be taken literally, else it will be proven fault. 

Forever to me means I never want it to end. But in reality, it will end. So what, I can still enjoy the movie and popcorn. ‚ò∫Ô∏è","If you are lay person(not monk), you can still have romantic relationship, there is nothing stopping in Buddhism. But there are healthy recommendations to follow(precept)... Abstaining from having romantic relation with others mate, children, those under still protection and with prostitutes.

You don't need starve. Being said that, once you attain higher states, you will develop dispassion towards physical relationship due to proper understanding. But you'll still love opposite person with you heart. This happens as you progress.",,,,,,,,,,

Any kind of intentional killing is frowned on. Especially when the one you're killing is yourself. As u/optimistically_eyed wrote: This topic comes up *a lot* and you'd be better off using the sub's search function to find more information about what the teachings have to say.","&gt; Are there any relevant scriptures?

To my knowledge there is one passage (SA 809) in which the Buddha expresses his disapproval with a group of monks who meditated incorrectly on the repulsiveness of the body and comitted suicide afterwards. In the same text suicide as a method to generate merit is also portrayed as wrong view and one of Mara's cunning lies.

However, in SN 4.23 Mara tries to get the Buddha to stop Godhika from killing himself. The Buddha doesn't do it, Godhika commits suicide, and attains complete awakening.

I don't think there is a contradiction between the two above. In my limited understanding of these sutras: in the first passage the monks were clearly afflicted by aversion and flawed knowledge, while in the second Godhika had reached very high levels of wisdom already, and the problem was some kind of degenerative issue with his attainments.

So I think there are instances in which suicide is permissible, but it requires the person to **1)** be an arhat and **2)** be suffering from some form of serious illness or another degenerative condition.

Adding to that so that no depressive Buddhists start getting wrong ideas, one thing to remember is that even great lamas with palpable attainments and *decades* of high-level training did **not** commit suicide while under torture, mutilation, or while sick. So it's quite arrogant to claim this right to oneself.

.

As a sidenote to my first paragraph, I cringe every time I see people in this sub telling others to practice that same type of meditation, as that's mighty irresponsible in my opinion.",,,,,,,,,,

Buddhism and Jainism are distinguished on this point. Jainism considers even accidental killing wrong action, so it's practitioners sweep the ground on front of them to avoid stepping on an insect, even by mistake. 

The Buddha's teaching by contrast looks at what the mind is doing, and seeks to purify mental intent, and not just physical action.","&gt;For example, you‚Äôre playing a game with someone and they get really angry when they loose.

Ask yourself how would this make you feel, and that's your answer. Even witnessing a thing like this leaves a scar, and I can only imagine how actually killing someone can feel...

You see, it is not really about what others think of your acts - for this, we have our legal and moral system.

377,,Buddhism,"This question has plagued me ever since I read the entrance requirements for a forest Buddhist monestary and retreat in Thailand where it said that people with depression should not come to the monestary for the retreat. Also after going to local meditation groups and meditating under an instructor in a temple in Bangkok as well as reading and practicing on my own, I could not understand the message about selflessness in Buddhism.

And they don't want the risk and responsibility of dealing with this in large groups.

There is some overlap between mental illnesses of the medical sort and the spiritual ones that Buddhism works on. But we suppose medical issues to have some physical basis and require some modern medication and therapy. Applying spiritual methods may be helpful to some extent - and this is what some forms of therapies systematically do - but that is not recommended as a primary approach. 

The Buddhist teaching on the self and ego is subtle. You should not blindly accept and apply it unless you see exactly how it works.","I have a string of metal illnesses. ADHD, Depersonalization Distorter, and I'm Narcoleptic. These come with depression and DP is an anxiety disorder.

If we are talking about a situation of ptsd, meditation could be used to help, but the patient should still seek out professional help and if psychologists think that drugs would help this person then they are probably necessary. Are you being treated for your condition? What does your councilor say? If they don‚Äôt have an opinion either way maybe seek out a councilor trained in both psychology and meditation. They are out there. 

I have met people with mental health issues that meditate. It all depends on the type of issue. In fact I‚Äôve heard stories about people who have most likely had undiagnosed mental health issues, or otherwise, yet became monks or went on long retreats because this structured environment was what they thought they needed. The outside world was too much. 

Talk with some councilors who know what they are talking about. And think of meditation as something you could do along with the help you receive, not as the replacement for it.",,,,,,,,,,

He said something like this, the Buddha considers himself as a doctor so you can say my doctor forbids me to drink.","Yes, it means total abstinence from alcohol. The precept is abstaining from *consuming* intoxicants which lead to heedlessness, not abstaining from heedlessness. Even one sip is still consumption. If there was a precept about abstaining from heedlessness, very few people would be able to keep it. 

The hardest part is the beginning where your friends and family don't fully understand that you're not drinking anymore, ever. They'll keep offering you alcohol, and you have to remain committed. Eventually they give up. How soon this happens depends on how considerate your folks are.

Thankfully, nowadays there are alternatives. There are alcohol free beers and wines. This allows you to fit in without drinking. But keep an eye on the percentage of alcohol. Some ""alcohol free"" beers are actually low alcohol not alcohol free. Look for ones the are &lt;0.1% alcohol. For example, Heineken 0 is 0.005% IIRC.","In general, my understanding is that the 5th precept is strict. It keeps things nice and simple, frankly and helps people avoid the tortured logic of ""well, I wanted to try this Beglian ale for taste because my family is originally from the Walloon regions and I think it's important to connect with... etc etc""

Just so you know, there is literally no time in your life when alcohol won't be hard to give up. That's sorta how it works.

Here's something you can try as an experiment if you are up for  it: commit to the precept for a month and see what happens. Imagine you are on some medication or something where you literally can't have a sip.

You will likely see that most/all of the drinks you turn down come from two places: 

1) simple habitual conditioning

2) a yearning for a 'break' from whatever stress you are experiencing in the moment

Once you see this, you can figure out if/how you'd like alcohol to be a part of your life.

Anyway, just some ideas. Good luck on your Path.",,,,,,,,,,

They're not really something we can just pick up from an internet comment. That said, in the Tibetan tradition the mantra *om mani padme hum* is said to have no restrictions or prerequisites. It is a mantra of Avalokiteshvara, also known as Chenrezig, Kuanyin or Kannon, the embodiment of universal compassion. By reciting it we invoke Avalokiteshvaras presence, blessing and guidance, for ourselves and those around is, and also come into contact with Avalokiteshvara's qualities of wisdom and compassion in our own being. You could try reciting that, and see if it is something that's fitting for you.

What was left was the Fanwang Jing precepts (a formulation of the Bodhisattva Precepts) which does not explicitly forbid sex even though it was commonly understood to do so for those who were monks. Regardless, state law forbid monks from having sex or eating meat, among other rules. However, it was either the founder of Jodo shu or Jodo Shin-shu that convinced the government that it was in their doctrine that a priest should understand the circumstances of the temple members and therefore priests should marry and have children. Thus and exception was made in the law for priests of the Jodo Shin-shu sect and later for Nichiren-shu as well. With the Meiji restoration, these laws were all repealed and all priests in Japan are free to marry and have children (even though it wasn't that uncommon before). This has resulted in temples being largely family owned and inherited.

The history of monastic regulation in Japan is interesting and complex.

Regarding Mt. Hiei, starting in the Heian period, it was for a long time regarded as the pinnacle place for scholarly training of Buddhist monks. The founders of Jodo-shu, Nichiren-shu, and Soto-shu began their training there.","My understanding is that being a ""monk"" in Japan is very different from the actual tradition.

With that said, indeed it is taught that there is the vehicle of gods and men, and the related brahma vehicle. The vehicle of gods and men, in general, I think relates to essentially a vehicle or view in which it is understood that there is virtue and non-virtue and that virtue and non-virtue can lead to results beyond this lifetime. The Brahma Vehicle then adds the brahmaviharas to this, basically.

So in general, I think you could say that if someone is, say, Christian and has such a view but that view does not include the idea of liberation from samsara, and if they are a ethical/virtuous person, then indeed they may end up in one of various 'heavenly' realms after this lifetime. At least for a time.

Beyond that, it seems to be quite speculative to posit that categorically everyone would end up in a singular, particular 'heavenly' birth. It seems like it would depend on many factors, to me.

FWIW.","Many religious people from other faiths share common practices with Buddhists.

So let‚Äôs take the practice of generosity towards a church that ends up the using that money to help children and people in need and the ones giving money or food know that‚Äôs where it goes. They do that all their lives because they are devoted to their religion and feel like that‚Äôs a genuinely right thing to do to out of a hood heart.
Such people indeed make a lot of merit and will very likely be born in some of the heavenly realms.

The heavenly realms are not buddhist only places. Actually in a lot of these realms these devas probably have no idea what Buddhism is. End up there and stay there and come back down eventually not knowing anything about the Buddha. But they were good people in their lives nonetheless.

But this is a lot of speculation that seems to make sense in my head.","The Brahma realm is said to be the origin of many monotheistic religions (they discuss it somewhere around the 11 minute mark): https://youtu.be/6iHzYoiSSzg

Following these religions won't necessarily lead to rebirth there, but the Brahma realm is considered to be what monotheists call heaven. Strong past ties to these realms are therefore sometimes strengthened by the religion. And that could lead to rebirth there. But that's mostly people who are neck deep into the religion, like prophets or mystics. Your average Sunday Church crowd probably not so much.",,,,,,,,,,

Always use them. ""will the timer not go off already?"" would occasionally come up but that passes, just like everything else passes. Watching stuff like that appear and disappear is a valuable experience.","Personally, I like the timer. 


I like it for logistical reasons, i.e. time management. If I know I have to do something in 40 minutes, I know I can set a timer for 30 minutes, meditate, and then do the other thing I need to do.


I also like it for mindfulness practice. If I feel any resistance (e.g. boredom, anxiety, impatience, etc) towards meditation, I know I must sit with it, regardless of how I feel. If I didn't have a set time, I would be way more likely to stop when I felt that resistance.

When that resistance comes up, I treat it like I'm tensing a muscle and I breathe, relax, and release the tension. The more resistance comes up, the more practice I have with diffusing resistance. 

Also, doing this during meditation is practice for doing it during the rest of the day.

So, it's not that I haven't had thoughts like ""am I half away through?"" or ""why hasn't the timer gone off yet?"", it's just I view those thoughts as a manifestation of resistance, specifically impatience, and therefore just something else to be mindful of and diffuse.

There is, of course, a place for timerless meditation. I just haven't pursued it because I get a lot out of my timed meditation and haven't really felt the need.","It is best to use a timer ‚Äî or an equivalent commitment such as to practice until you have recited a set number of mantras (if that is your practice).  A timer is the equivalent of setting boundaries on retreat.  

Without a timer, meditation tends to become about pleasure ‚Äî sitting while the session feels good and leaving when it becomes difficult.  We end up stopping practice just when the practice begins to be challenging and useful ‚Äî just when we are about to gain some insight.",,,,,,,,,,

If negative thoughts arise on their own and you don't respond to them negatively, you're not creating negative karma because the arising negative thoughts are due to previous karma. If you respond to them negatively (feeding into it, generating more unwholesome thoughts), then you're creating more negative karma.

You can work on reducing/eliminating your intrusive thoughts with a) meditation and b) working with a therapist. 

CBT or IFS therapies can both help with thinking compulsions. Obviously, it's ideal to work with a therapist. That said, there are books available that walk you through the process for self-healing. Just know that it's tricky and nuanced work.

My mom teaches yoga (I do too now) so there was always eastern philosophy floating around the house. I guess because of that, there wasn't really a 'converstion' I just started following Buddhist teachings and practices when I became an adult.","For me it was a relief from the (illusory) dependence on blood magic that is central to Christianity's doctrine of Jesus's ""atoning death"" on the cross. I stopped believing in ""sin"" as an affront to an angry god - and therefore dropped the need for a dying-rising savior. I walked away from the proposition that ""God"" must be a creator and First Cause. I accepted that true spiritual advance was not to (impossibly) pattern my life on that of a ""perfect God-Man"", but rather to walk the path of the Dharma and aim for enlightenment, not sainthood, as the ultimate religious goal. All in all, it was a feeling of unnecessary burdens lifted by the Buddha's teachings.","My father was a pastor for almost a decade, I was raised Christian, and I was baptized at 8 and 16. I now see the Christian Cannon through a Buddhist lens, but do not choose to follow its teachings or symbolism as I believe Buddhism is straight to the point and harder to confuse. 

Modern day Christianity is a complete  bastardization of the original teachings, in my opinion. And I don‚Äôt just mean Bible thumping hardline literalist Christians. My family is fairly open minded and I know some friends that are more new age Christian, but I still don‚Äôt believe they understand the tradition. Mostly because there is no actual practice involved except reading the Bible and contemplating it, and that‚Äôs usually only when life gets hard. To reach any spiritual understanding, the only way is practice and first hand experience. Seems like Christianity is so far from real life experience that first hand experience isn‚Äôt even necessary. 

Not to talk down to any Christians, I believe most of them have pure intentions. I just think most were never shown how to practice or live the path they believe they‚Äôre on, so they don‚Äôt.",,,,,,,,,,

&gt;**\[1\]** ""There is the case where a monk ‚Äî having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building ‚Äî sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore \[lit: the front of the chest\]. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.

He trains himself, 'I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.' He trains himself, 'I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.' Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice, when making a long turn, discerns, 'I am making a long turn,' or when making a short turn discerns, 'I am making a short turn'; in the same way the monk, when breathing in long, discerns, 'I am breathing in long'; or breathing out long, he discerns, 'I am breathing out long' ...

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And how does a monk remain focused on the body in &amp;amp; of itself?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[1]&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;There is the case where a monk ‚Äî having gone to the wilderness, to the shade of a tree, or to an empty building ‚Äî sits down folding his legs crosswise, holding his body erect and setting mindfulness to the fore [lit: the front of the chest]. Always mindful, he breathes in; mindful he breathes out.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Breathing in long, he discerns, &amp;#39;I am breathing in long&amp;#39;; or breathing out long, he discerns, &amp;#39;I am breathing out long.&amp;#39; Or breathing in short, he discerns, &amp;#39;I am breathing in short&amp;#39;; or breathing out short, he discerns, &amp;#39;I am breathing out short.&amp;#39; He trains himself, &amp;#39;I will breathe in sensitive to the entire body.&amp;#39; He trains himself, &amp;#39;I will breathe out sensitive to the entire body.&amp;#39; He trains himself, &amp;#39;I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.&amp;#39; He trains himself, &amp;#39;I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.&amp;#39; Just as a skilled turner or his apprentice, when making a long turn, discerns, &amp;#39;I am making a long turn,&amp;#39; or when making a short turn discerns, &amp;#39;I am making a short turn&amp;#39;; in the same way the monk, when breathing in long, discerns, &amp;#39;I am breathing in long&amp;#39;; or breathing out long, he discerns, &amp;#39;I am breathing out long&amp;#39; ... He trains himself, &amp;#39;I will breathe in calming bodily fabrication.&amp;#39; He trains himself, &amp;#39;I will breathe out calming bodily fabrication.&amp;#39;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the body in &amp;amp; of itself, or externally on the body in &amp;amp; of itself, or both internally &amp;amp; externally on the body in &amp;amp; of itself. Or he remains focused on the phenomenon of origination with regard to the body, on the phenomenon of passing away with regard to the body, or on the phenomenon of origination &amp;amp; passing away with regard to the body. Or his mindfulness that &amp;#39;There is a body&amp;#39; is maintained to the extent of knowledge &amp;amp; remembrance. And he remains independent, unsustained by (not clinging to) anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in &amp;amp; of itself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[2]&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Furthermore, when walking, the monk discerns, &amp;#39;I am walking.&amp;#39; When standing, he discerns, &amp;#39;I am standing.&amp;#39; When sitting, he discerns, &amp;#39;I am sitting.&amp;#39; When lying down, he discerns, &amp;#39;I am lying down.&amp;#39; Or however his body is disposed, that is how he discerns it.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the body in &amp;amp; of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in &amp;amp; of itself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[3]&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Furthermore, when going forward &amp;amp; returning, he makes himself fully alert; when looking toward &amp;amp; looking away... when bending &amp;amp; extending his limbs... when carrying his outer cloak, his upper robe &amp;amp; his bowl... when eating, drinking, chewing, &amp;amp; savoring... when urinating &amp;amp; defecating... when walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep, waking up, talking, &amp;amp; remaining silent, he makes himself fully alert.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the body in &amp;amp; of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in &amp;amp; of itself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[4]&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Furthermore... just as if a sack with openings at both ends were full of various kinds of grain ‚Äî wheat, rice, mung beans, kidney beans, sesame seeds, husked rice ‚Äî and a man with good eyesight, pouring it out, were to reflect, &amp;#39;This is wheat. This is rice. These are mung beans. These are kidney beans. These are sesame seeds. This is husked rice,&amp;#39; in the same way, monks, a monk reflects on this very body from the soles of the feet on up, from the crown of the head on down, surrounded by skin and full of various kinds of unclean things: &amp;#39;In this body there are head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines, gorge, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, skin-oil, saliva, mucus, fluid in the joints, urine.&amp;#39;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the body in &amp;amp; of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in &amp;amp; of itself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[5]&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Furthermore... just as a skilled butcher or his apprentice, having killed a cow, would sit at a crossroads cutting it up into pieces, the monk contemplates this very body ‚Äî however it stands, however it is disposed ‚Äî in terms of properties: &amp;#39;In this body there is the earth property, the liquid property, the fire property, &amp;amp; the wind property.&amp;#39;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In this way he remains focused internally on the body in &amp;amp; of itself, or focused externally... unsustained by anything in the world. This is how a monk remains focused on the body in &amp;amp; of itself.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[6]&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;quot;Furthermore, as if he were to see a corpse cast away in a charnel ground ‚Äî one day, two days, three days dead ‚Äî bloated, livid, &amp;amp; festering, he applies it to this very body, &amp;#39;This body, too: Such is its nature, such is its future, such its unavoidable fate&amp;#39;...  &lt;/p&gt;

The Buddha taught the Path to Nibbana/Nirvana so that living beings could be free from the cycle of Samsara, the endless rounds of birth and death.

The more I think about this, the more I see Buddhism as being ultimately anti-life. It is not Nihilistic because there is a distinct meaning and intention within the teaching. It is however a teaching which is essentially against the continuation of living. This is rationalized through the teachings of not-self, that there isnt any 'thing' to be reborn but I see this too as inherently anti-life. The teaching is that conventional life isnt actually meaningful in itself because its experienced through ignorance. Instead the only meaning of life in Buddhism is the escape from life. 

I understand that many people are buddhists who do not believe in literal cosmological rebirth.

Generally, Buddhists regard sa·πÉsƒÅra to contain innumerable beings.

&gt;The more I think about this, the more I see Buddhism as being ultimately anti-life

It is anti-continued rebirth, and being a living being happens because of continued rebirth, so in that sense perhaps it is anti-life.

But nevertheless there are better births and thus better lives than others, and of course Buddhists believe in rebirth, so some of the things that might follow from other so-called ""anti-life doctrines"" might not follow from Buddhism. For example, the goodness of suicide does not follow from Buddhist premises, nor does the badness of having children if one is unable or unwilling to take up celibacy as part of the training.

So there are important ways in which Buddhism does not have features which ""anti-life"" might connote.","The Buddhist path is universal in that it is availble to anyone interested in putting pointless wandering to an end. It is not universal in the sense that it is something all beings are obligated or destined to follow.

https://www.dhammatalks.org/suttas/AN/AN10_95.html

Something to keep in mind is that life and death do not apply to an arahant. An arahant is completely unbound by birth and death.","&gt;Is the goal of Buddhism the extinguishing of all life?

The goal is the extinguishing of suffering. If you became annihilated upon attaining Nibbana, he would have said so. But he explicitly rejected that idea:

&gt;""Speaking in this way, teaching in this way, I have been erroneously, vainly, falsely, unfactually misrepresented by some brahmans and contemplatives \[who say\], 'Gotama the contemplative is one who misleads. He declares the annihilation, destruction, extermination of the existing being.' But as I am not that, as I do not say that, so I have been erroneously, vainly, falsely, unfactually misrepresented by those venerable brahmans and contemplatives \[who say\], 'Gotama the contemplative is one who misleads. He declares the annihilation, destruction, extermination of the existing being.' [\[13\]](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.than.html#fn-13)  
&gt;  
&gt;""Both formerly and now, monks, I declare only stress and the cessation of stress. [\[14\]](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.than.html#fn-14)

Throughout the Pali Canon the Buddha gave the imagery of Nibbana as 'unbinding', 'release', 'freedom', etc. all words used to describe someone who was once bound (imprisoned) and then set free. But he was careful to teach in a way that led the mind to non-clinging, not fixating on yet another self bound in Nibbana.

&gt;The more I think about this, the more I see Buddhism as being ultimately anti-life.

It's more suitable to view the Buddha as a doctor curing an illness. He lays out the diagnosis of the illness, the cause, the cure, and the path of practice so that it doesn't come back.",,,,,,,,,,

I think, to be honest, that if one studies einsteinian physics sufficiently and contemplates the implications sufficiently, it basically would break the world-view of most people, it would seem. Partly/largely due to implications regarding the nature of time.

There are actually some interesting quotes by Einstein.

Near the end of his life, in discussing someone else who died, he said,

&gt;Now he has again preceded me a little in parting from this strange world. This has no importance. For people like us who believe in physics, the separation between past, present and future has only the importance of an admittedly tenacious illusion.

He also is quoted as saying things like,

&gt;The only reason for time is so that everything doesn‚Äôt happen at once.

and

&gt;A human being is a part of the whole called by us universe, a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feeling as something separated from the rest, a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us, restricting us to our personal desires and to affection for a few persons nearest to us. Our task must be to free ourselves from this prison by widening our circle of compassion to embrace all living creatures and the whole of nature in its beauty.

and even

&gt;All religions, arts and sciences are branches of the same tree.

In general, I think the actual nature of reality, so to speak, is not at all what we typically think of, when it comes to our very particular sensory and cognitive/neurological systems.

With all of that said, I don't think your post really directly relates to Buddhism very much. Although it seems to me that when it comes to Buddhahood, a Buddha actually has insight into these things.

I don't think you'll get much support for worshipping black holes here though. FWIW.

The trouble with this question is that it ignores what it means to say that something ‚Äúexists‚Äù.   Existence is an important concept in Buddhism.  To say that something ‚Äúexists‚Äù is to say that it is understood in relation to other things ‚Äî that (i) it is interdependent and arises in relationship to other things, (ii) that it was created as a result of causes and conditions, and (iii) that it has qualities.   

For example, a block of ice exists because it has qualities.  It has qualities such as coldness because it exists in interdependent relation to things (such as fire) that have other qualities.  And it arises, dwells for a time, and disappears based on the coming together and dissipation of causes and conditions; it is impermanent.  It exists in a relative sense, in time.

The post would be more interesting if it addressed the meaning of existence and then went further to consider what the Heart Sutra is talking about when it negates both existence and non-existence and says ‚Äúthere are no characteristics‚Äù.",,,rich:video,https://youtu.be/_IJllLZyXxE,"{'images': [{'source': {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/wUSPMjMnWxOnQGc10NEUeAQH81FQ1dphtaTnIFDhumk.jpg?auto=webp&amp;s=ec08313f196f8c308a4087e91ab72dd9b1358bc8', 'width': 480, 'height': 360}, 'resolutions': [{'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/wUSPMjMnWxOnQGc10NEUeAQH81FQ1dphtaTnIFDhumk.jpg?width=108&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6479867abbbd373eedb59e7013829d55d337cb86', 'width': 108, 'height': 81}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/wUSPMjMnWxOnQGc10NEUeAQH81FQ1dphtaTnIFDhumk.jpg?width=216&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1d921215bf89d4bd5f361b37dd0606d915a83344', 'width': 216, 'height': 162}, {'url': 'https://external-preview.redd.it/wUSPMjMnWxOnQGc10NEUeAQH81FQ1dphtaTnIFDhumk.jpg?width=320&amp;crop=smart&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=300e38a6da5bb85e7c804cfd0f41ae71693e6643', 'width': 320, 'height': 240}], 'variants': {}, 'id': '0rP-DRtOrg7VcAm1sOxAueih8b65tJb5Ec2jJXUO1HA'}], 'enabled': False}",,,,,,,
412,,Buddhism,"Practicing mindfulness is like giving your mind a home. 

When you first start to practice, it's nothing more than a rough straw mat out in the open. Then as time goes on, you progress from the mat, to building foundations, then walls and finally the roof to give an unshakeable home. 

For your mind to have this secure home, a peaceful place, you need to keep at it. You need to keep building. If you let up, rats will come and eat the materials you've bought,  and you'll be left again with the rough mat. You'll have to start all over again. 

Mindfulness is daily practice - a continuous practice. Think of what sort of home you want to give your mind - Peace and stillness? Loving kindness? Lightness and clarity? 

Then fix your mind on the object that brings you that. Return again and again to that object. Make that the overwhelming preoccupation of your mind. This is mindfulness. 

If you pick one object one day, and another one another day, on another day you give up, and then another day you come back to try something different, you'll never get anywhere. No house will be built at the end of the day. 

Know what your mind needs, what it responds to, and give it that. Return again and again to a single wholesome object that brings you that, and make that recollection strong. This object of preoccupation is what the Buddha calls 'awareness-release'.

What we're taking about here is the quality of mind that you wish to reside in - the citta, the mind/heart.

415,,Buddhism,"I have been meditating for about 6 months now through the pandemic. I do not know if I truly consider myself a buddhist, as I have not had the opportunity to attend any temple in my city because of lockdown restrictions, but I am practicing and it is helping me through difficult times, and I believe what I understand to be the basic teachings of buddhism. I ask this question here because I have no teacher or other forum to go to.

What initially attracted me to meditation was a lifelong struggle with depression. A lot of the pain in my life is centred around sex to it, both due to sexual traumas I have suffered and because of my own attachment to sexual pleasure. I have become almost obsessed with eliminating my libido and living a life without attachment to sexual pleasure, to the point of considering chemical castration. Antidepressants and therapy have never helped me to control my libido, but after meditating consistently for a time I noticed that my libido was declining naturally.

This realisation brought me immense joy, and controlling my libido quickly became the main focus of my practice. It was a great motivator and allowed me to practice when I would otherwise find it difficult, but since this initial change in my sexual desires I have found myself chasing freedom from lust above everything else. In general, meditation is still beneficial to me and I feel much better than before, but I wonder if my desire to lose this specific form of attachment is clouding my judgment and making it harder for me to ultimately let go. Is it better for me to simply meditate without focusing on overcoming a specific attachment? Or is the motivation that this gives me useful?

There's a part in the Vinaya (monastic rules) where a monk cuts off his own unit due to strong sexual desire. The Buddha says that it is an offense and says that where the monk cut off one thing (his unit) he should have cut off another thing (desire).

‚ÄãIn my opinion, there's nothing wrong with wanting to overcome lust. That wanting could be used skillfully as motivation to practice well. The Buddhist path eventually leads to the abandoning of sensuality which includes sexuality. It's lessened at the second stage of enlightenment (called once returner - that person will return at most one more time to the world) and it ceases for someone at the third stage of enlightenment (non returner - that person will not be born in the sensual realms again). If that wanting to get beyond sexuality leads to extreme actions like cutting off your unit or even chemical castration then it's gone too far into harmful territory. So in my opinion, if you can use that desire as motivation to skillfully develop the whole Buddhist path, it's skillful.

I have a shrine at home.

Buddhism has tons of prayer though? Veneration is a type of prayer, and it doesn't imply they can hear you. Its often considered good for its own sake. It sounds like your coworkers are largely correct that the statues are treated with reverence and used for prayer.","&gt; Am I just particularly non reverential or something?

I think for the most part, you're okay, there's only one thing I thought was odd:

&gt; They think the statue by itself has some strange sacrality or something like that and were shocked when I just popped into a box.

I find your comment here odd because, traditionally speaking, there are two views on this that I'm aware of:

* Consecrated Buddha-rupa are, by virtue of the ritual consecration, imbued with and embody part of the Dharmakaya itself, and thus is a literal representation of the Buddhadharma in physical form
* Consecrated Buddha-rupa become the abodes of yakshas and devas that worship and serve the Buddhadharma, so caring for your altar and shrine space is both about reverence to the symbolic representations of the dharma, but also compassionate conduct to the actual divine beings that make these images their home

So there's definitely supposed to be a regarding of an embodied sacrosanct nature to the statues themselves. Assuming, of course, they have been consecrated.

&gt; I am not sure how one prays to the Buddha given the Buddha technically is in Nirvana bhuta and can no longer hear us

You offer prayers and pay homage. Prayer is broader than petitioning for divine intercession. But even petitionary prayers can be performed, generally by calling upon bodhisattvas or the aforementioned yakshas and devas to help clear obstacles on the path--essentially calling for help from all the various beings in the ten directions that honor and revere the Buddhas.",,,,,,,,,,,

There's a reason why some people are able to start practicing diligently right away, while others dabble in the training for decades without really getting their feet wet.","This is what dharani and mantra are actually supposed to be used for--in a way, mantra practice is sorta like ""saving your progress"" into your mindstream in order to more effectively recall in future lives.

In Nagarjuna's Mahaprajnaparamita Upadesa, he writes,

&gt; The Bodhisattva who possess the DhƒÅra·πáƒ´, due to the power of his memory (sm·πõtibala), is able to keep and not forget all teachings he hears (≈õrutadharma).

And the Bodhisattvabhumi of the Yogacarabhumisastra delineates four kinds of dharani, stating:

&gt;  **Dharma-dhƒÅra·πáƒ´**  : By her/his memorizing and wisdom faculties, theBodhisattva retains innumerable teachings (Dharmas) in their names, phrases, and phonemes.

&gt; **Artha-dhƒÅra·πáƒ´** : It is the same as the previous one, but here the meanings ( artha) of those teachings are retained.


&gt; **Mantra-dhƒÅra·πáƒ´**  : i.e., ‚Äòa dhƒÅra·πáƒ´ that is a mantra‚Äô. Because of her/his samƒÅdhi mastery, the Bodhisattva ‚Äòspiritually supports‚Äô (adhi·π£·π≠hita) the mantra-words (mantra- padas), becoming thus ‚Äòsupremely effective and infallible‚Äô to appease the distresses of sentient beings.

&gt; **Bodhisattva-k·π£ƒÅnti-lƒÅbhƒÅya-dhƒÅra·πáƒ´** : i.e., ‚Äòthe dhƒÅra·πáƒ´  which give rise to the receptivity of a Bodhisattva‚Äô. It consists in meditating on the sense of a mantra promulgated by the Buddha as ‚ÄòtadyathƒÅ i·π≠i mi·π≠i ki·π≠i bhik·π£ƒÅnti padƒÅni svƒÅhƒÅ‚Äô, until it is realized that these mantra-words have no meaning, this, namely ‚Äòno-meaningness‚Äô (nitarthathƒÅ), is indeed their meaning. Then, the Bodhisattva realizes the meaning of all dharmas as follows: the meaning of the ‚Äòown being‚Äô ( svabhƒÅva) of all dharmas is not completely revealed by any number of words; the absence of expressible essence is the meaning of their essence (tr. Inagaki, in Anir : 14-15; Kapstein, 2001: 237-238)

So depending on your previous cultivation, it might just be terminology and concepts and general structures that come easily to you, or the ability to learn mantras and dharanis themselves come easily.. or at a more advanced level, the meanings of teachings become more powerful. mantra-dharanis are those that are created and magically imbued with power by highly attained bodhisattvas in order to help the rest of us with our progress.

This is part of the reason why liturgical chanting is such a major component of practice in so many different traditions--it is believed that maintaining these liturgies is part of the practice of being able to carry the teachings with us into future lives, or least be able to draw back upon them more easily.

What are your thoughts on this?

My thoughts are that all of these things can bring 'fake' happiness. When you are sad, you put on music or watch a movie. You have not fixed your sadness, you have simply masked it for a short period.

However, I must disagree. I do not believe that people should abstain from singing, dancing or instrumental music. I play the piano, for instance, and believe that it helps train my brain by learning sheet music. Similarly, singing and dancing can be a result of happiness. For instance, sometimes when I am happy, I will dance on the spot.

You also have to consider that at that time, places where there was singing, dancing, and music were places where there is debauchery, drinking, etc. But in general, monastics have to conduct themselves in a way that is respectable and doesn't discredit the sangha. Many people seeing monks and nuns having a party or playing video games or whatever would scoff, saying they're shirking their duties.

But these standards do not apply to laypersons, except temporarily during the uposatha observations.

I am a musician as well.","In some ways you could think of a monastic life as being a training, in this case for full awakening.

Something that is inappropriate in a training is not necessarily categorically inappropriate outside of that training.

Like if you were in training to be a doctor, you might commit to 4 years of medical school. In that four years, there is a certain structure, a certain commitment that you take.

If you are committed to becoming a doctor, you would commit yourself to that structure. You wouldn't, say, simply go off to the beach for months at a time to surf, or you wouldn't get so involved in World of Warcraft that you get your level 110 Paladin to some final raid boss in the first 2 weeks of release of an expansion, or whatever. Those things may be ok in some situations, but if you are committed to your medical training, there is that commitment and you need to hold to that commitment of your attention and effort if you want to finish your training successfully.

Similarly, in the context of the goal of a monastic life, indulgence in such things basically are not appropriate for that goal.

If you want to do those things, just don't become a monastic, basically.

But if you want to commit fully to full awakening, then it may be worthwhile to 'commit to the program' in some instances, basically.","That section of DN 1 is about what actions are inappropriate for monastics who live off alms to engage in, when outwardly representing the tradition.",,,,,,,,,,

I might venture a guess that initially, a stream-winner may still basically engage in ill will/sensuous craving in the sense that one sort of ... gets caught in it, whereas in a once-returner it still can habitually pop up but one isn't really entirely caught by it, it's sort of seen as being habitual and without a real core, perhaps.

With non-return, these things have no more basis for arising at all.

But that's just what comes to mind I guess. FWIW.

/u/potentpalipotables any thoughts?","In [this](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an03/an03.085.than.html) sutta the Buddha refers to it as an attenuation implying a gradual degradation.

Through other teachings the Buddha implied the entire process is like a gravitational pull.

&gt;*""Suppose a tree were leaning toward the east, slanting toward the east, inclining toward the east. When its root is cut, which way would it fall?""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""In whichever way it was leaning, slanting, and inclining, lord.""*  
&gt;  
&gt;*""In the same way, Mahanama, a disciple of the noble ones, when endowed with four qualities, leans toward Unbinding, slants toward Unbinding, inclines toward Unbinding."" -SN 55.22*

 A stream-enterer is destined for awakening within 7 births, and that includes dying and 'forgetting' everything.

* stream entry - wasting away 3 lower fetters
* once-returner - wasting away of 3 lower fetters, attenuation of other 2
* non-returner - wasting away of 5 lower fetters","My understanding is that any significant degradation ( not by quantity but by quality ) of craving and ill will suffices. It is a qualitative description. 

Sotapanna as you know have not actually cut off craving and ill will ... they just no longer have clinging to self, attachment to rituals and doubt. 

Anagamin have no ill will and craving.

Sakadagamin is just lessened. So a Sakadagamin can have ill will ... just not so much ( ie:- the Sakadagamin dislikes something far less than before, or has less things he or she now dislikes ) and the Sakadagamin can still crave ... but what they crave for is no longer so much or so intense.",,,,,,,,,,

The holes I thought i saw were covered by a treatise I hadn't caught or even just some verbiage I missed here or there.

So when I applied scrutiny to the logical process of rebirth as a consequence of karma's conditioning relationship to experiential phenomena, I found it to be airtight. When i went back to apply scrutiny to my earlier worldview, I found it actually full of holes, held onto only because of familiarity. It appeared to me that the foundational premises of physicalism or realism rest on inconjectureables or loose associations, and the premises of Buddhist epistemology already refute the physicalist premises. So if you take physicalism on its own terms, you have these premises for which there are relatively strong refutations (although this may be entirely due to this tradition not having a long history of having to stand up against Buddhist criticisms). If you take Buddhist epistemic reasoning on *its* own terms, it already accounts for any criticisms lobbied at it from the physicalist and realist schools (and, again, this may also be a historical bias from Buddhism having a longer history of having to refute these ideas).","""""But when the Blessed One says to me, 'At the break-up of the body, after death, one who gives, who is a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world,' that I do not know. That is where I go by conviction in the Blessed One.""

""So it is, Siha. So it is. At the break-up of the body, after death, one who gives, who is a master of giving, reappears in a good destination, the heavenly world.""""

- Siha Sutta

https://accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.034.than.html","I believe in rebirth without the Self. It is the **Rebirth of hate, greed and ignorance.** This rebirth then leads to rebirth of *a* Self.

Mind you, not any particular self, not this Self, not my Self. Just A Self.

It's not a belief, I see it.

As for the rebirth after death of This Self, this person, my Self, in another lifetime, in another being - this I do not expect, nor do I believe it to be possible, nor do I believe to even contemplate it is necessary.  There is no true self even now, so what's the use of talking about its supposed post-mortem adventures?

*___------___*

I believe that *other realms* are in this very lifetime, where this here Self, my Self, finds itself when circumstances so arrange. I've been around for already quite many years, and I have been wondering between the realms... 

Sometimes heaven, sometimes hell, sometimes a ghost, sometimes s human, sometimes a pure animal... always a human, on the outside.

The drifting is rare these days, I am where I am, I am what I do. I die each evening and am reborn each morning, days come with no announcements: ""Welcome to the ... realm!"" It is what it is.

This too I see.

As for those other, faraway, supposedly real places, of which so many talk about, though unknown &amp; not visited by anyone present here, I cannot see those, so I don't know. 

I do however believe that people do sincerely believe those are real, so I do believe they are indeed real **- for them**. For me, those places do not exist, except in the way I described here.",,,,,,,,,,

Also, while Theravada is arguably a school or sect of Buddhism, Mahayana and Vajrayana aren't. Secular Buddhism arguably isn't Buddhism, but a form of materialistic humanism that borrows some aspects from Buddhism. 

Your questionnaire seems very meditation oriented, without specifying what you mean by that word. Many of the things that are called meditation have nothing to with Buddhism, and not all Buddhist traditions and practitioners emphasize forms of meditation. In the traditions that do, there's more to the practice than just meditation.

Just some points.",,,,,,,,,,,,
434,,Buddhism,"The teaching of the [Two Truths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_truths_doctrine) as explained by various texts and teachers:


&gt;From the perspective of subtle dependent arising, all phenomena are empty of inherent existence and exist by being merely designated by names and concepts. How, then, do we maintain a coherent notion of our everyday world? How can we accept causes producing results and maintain the distinctions among different objects if ultimately everything lacks inherent existence and exists by mere designation? The Buddha‚Äôs teaching on the two truths ‚Äî ultimate and conventional ‚Äî helps us understand this.

&gt;Ultimate (paramƒÅrtha) truth ‚Äî the emptiness of inherent existence of all phenomena ‚Äî is the actual way phenomena exist. Ultimate truths are true in that they exist the way they appear to the nonconceptual wisdom of ƒÅryas. *Sa·πÉv·πõti,* the Sanskrit word translated as ""convention,"" also means ""veil,"" indicating that the actual truth of an object is obscured or veiled ‚Äî the veil being ignorance, the mind grasping inherent existence. Due to ignorance, phenomena appear inherently existent, whereas they are not. Veiled truths are not true ‚Äî they do not exist as they appear ‚Äî they are true only for ignorance, and as such, are false. Our everyday world of people, things, and experiences are veiled truths.

&gt;To give another example, people gave me the title Dalai Lama. If you attend a public teaching that I give, you look at the person in the front of the room who is speaking and think, ‚ÄúThis is the Dalai Lama,‚Äù as if there were an objective person out there, a person that exists from his own side. But when you search for exactly what that person is, you can‚Äôt pinpoint anything. You see the body of a Buddhist monk and hear a voice. Through my body language and speech, you have some idea of what is going on in my mind. But when you look in the body, speech, and mind, you can‚Äôt find the Dalai Lama. He is not his body, speech, or mind. The appearance of the Dalai Lama as an inherently existent person is false. Actually he exists because on the basis of the collection of body and mind,your mind forms the conception of a person that you then designate the ‚ÄúDalai Lama.‚Äù The Dalai Lama exists by being merely designated by name and concept. That is his conventional nature. The deeper way he exists - his ultimate nature - is the emptiness of being an inherently existent Dalai Lama.

&gt;For each phenomenon, the two truths are present on that one base. For example, the mind has a veiled or conventional nature and a deeper reality or ultimate nature. Its conventional nature is its clarity and cognizance, the mind that perceives and experiences things. Its ultimate nature is its emptiness of inherent existence. These two truths exist inseparably with respect to the mind, although they are perceived by different cognizers. The conventional mind is perceived by a conventional reliable cognizer, while the ultimate nature of the mind is known by a wisdom mind that realizes emptiness. Although the two truths are different, they exist together and depend on each other. For that reason, the mind and its emptiness are said to be one nature but nominally different. The two truths are not two unrelated levels of being, with ultimate truth being some absolute independent reality separate from the world of interdependent things.

&gt;The very meaning of the term dependent arising enables us to gain insight into the union of the two truths. Everything exists dependent on or in relation to other factors that are not it. Flowers depend on seeds, a human being depends on his or her body and mind, space depends on the lack of obstruction. Being dependent, they are empty of inherent existence. But emptiness doesn‚Äôt mean total nonexistence. Because flowers, humans, and space arise, these veiled truths exist.

&gt;The Buddhas have taught the two truths, the relative and the ultimate, for the sake of establishing the nature of knowable things.

&gt;'Relative truth' includes all types of perceived phenomena: the 'ground' which refers to the aggregates, elements, and sense-sources comprising the conditioned and the unconditioned; the 'path' which refers to the paramitas and the bodhi factors; and the 'fruition' which refers to the  ten powers and so forth. In short, defined in terms of the unfailing 'perceived mode' of all knowables, relative truth refers to the extensive aspects of all existent phenomena.

&gt;Defined in terms of the 'real mode' of all these phenomena of ground, path and fruition, 'ultimate truth' refers to the profound aspect of the nature as it is and to the fact that the nature of phenomena is emptiness which cannot be established as anything whatsoever.

&gt;Realizing that these two truths are, in the perfect sense, an indivisible equality is the final meaning - the most eminent among all objects of realization.

&gt;The Buddha's teaching of the Dharma is based on two truths: a truth of worldly convention and an ultimate truth. Those who do not understand the distinction between these two truths do not understand the Buddha's profound teaching. Without depending on the conventional truth, the meaning of the ultimate cannot be taught. Without understanding the meaning of the ultimate, Nirvana is not achieved. By a misperception of emptiness, a person of little intelligence is destroyed, like a snake incorrectly seized or a spell incorrectly cast. (24.8 - 11)

&gt;If you regard all things as existing in virtue of their essence, then you will regard all things as being without causes and conditions. Effects and causes, instrument and action, and arising and ceasing will be undermined. That which is dependent origination is explained to be emptiness. (24.16 - 18)

&gt;Not dependant on another, peaceful, not fabricated by fabrications, not conceptualized, without distinctions - this is the characteristic of things as they are (18.9)

&gt; ... *Nagarjuna - Mulamadhyamakakarika (Fundamental treatise on the Middle Way)*

&gt;There are two ways of seeing every thing: the authentic way and the false way. Therefore, every thing found holds two natures within. The Buddha taught that authentic seeing sees reality‚Äôs precise nature. And false seeing sees relative truth.

&gt;Within false seeing, there are also two types: Perception with clear faculties and perception with flawed faculties. In dependence upon there being consciousness with properly functioning faculties, consciousness, when the faculty is flawed is called mistaken.

&gt;The objects perceived by the six consciousnesses whose faculties are free from fault are the things that worldly beings know. And it is they alone who say these things are real.Everything else is mistaken, they say.

&gt;Just as the vision of one stricken by an eye disease cannot controvert what the consciousness of one with healthy vision perceives, so those whose minds have rejected stainless wisdom cannot invalidate what those with stainless minds realize.

&gt;Bewilderment obscures the true nature, so it is relative. Whatever it contrives appears to be true. This the Mighty One called the relative truth. The noble ones know these contrived things to be merely relative.

&gt;False entities that are imagined to exist, such as the falling hairs that appear to one stricken with eye disease. How their nature is seen by one with flawless eyesight - this is how you should understand reality‚Äôs precise nature to be. (6.23 - 29)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the perspective of subtle dependent arising, all phenomena are empty of inherent existence and exist by being merely designated by names and concepts. How, then, do we maintain a coherent notion of our everyday world? How can we accept causes producing results and maintain the distinctions among different objects if ultimately everything lacks inherent existence and exists by mere designation? The Buddha‚Äôs teaching on the two truths ‚Äî ultimate and conventional ‚Äî helps us understand this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimate (paramƒÅrtha) truth ‚Äî the emptiness of inherent existence of all phenomena ‚Äî is the actual way phenomena exist. Ultimate truths are true in that they exist the way they appear to the nonconceptual wisdom of ƒÅryas. &lt;em&gt;Sa·πÉv·πõti,&lt;/em&gt; the Sanskrit word translated as &amp;quot;convention,&amp;quot; also means &amp;quot;veil,&amp;quot; indicating that the actual truth of an object is obscured or veiled ‚Äî the veil being ignorance, the mind grasping inherent existence. Due to ignorance, phenomena appear inherently existent, whereas they are not. Veiled truths are not true ‚Äî they do not exist as they appear ‚Äî they are true only for ignorance, and as such, are false. Our everyday world of people, things, and experiences are veiled truths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To give another example, people gave me the title Dalai Lama. If you attend a public teaching that I give, you look at the person in the front of the room who is speaking and think, ‚ÄúThis is the Dalai Lama,‚Äù as if there were an objective person out there, a person that exists from his own side. But when you search for exactly what that person is, you can‚Äôt pinpoint anything. You see the body of a Buddhist monk and hear a voice. Through my body language and speech, you have some idea of what is going on in my mind. But when you look in the body, speech, and mind, you can‚Äôt find the Dalai Lama. He is not his body, speech, or mind. The appearance of the Dalai Lama as an inherently existent person is false. Actually he exists because on the basis of the collection of body and mind,your mind forms the conception of a person that you then designate the ‚ÄúDalai Lama.‚Äù The Dalai Lama exists by being merely designated by name and concept. That is his conventional nature. The deeper way he exists - his ultimate nature - is the emptiness of being an inherently existent Dalai Lama.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For each phenomenon, the two truths are present on that one base. For example, the mind has a veiled or conventional nature and a deeper reality or ultimate nature. Its conventional nature is its clarity and cognizance, the mind that perceives and experiences things. Its ultimate nature is its emptiness of inherent existence.

You can still help your deceased father by reciting [amitabha sutra](https://foguangpedia.org/amitabha-sutra/) and [Ksitigarbha sutra](https://foguangpedia.org/ksitigarbha-sutra/), and dedicate the merits to him.

438,,Buddhism,"Hi Everyone, 

Just been seeing a few posts on illness in this community and I'd like to share this story. I hope it inspires someone to try a Medicine Buddha practice. My story, however, you can make of it what you will. I've never told anybody (apart from my teacher and Sangha at the time) this story for reasons you'll be able to guess. A friend of mine was diagnosed with an immune disorder for a decade and was becoming sicker and sicker until her colleagues were making grim predictions about her recovery.  I was chanting the Medicine Buddha at that time daily and I suggested she chant the Medicine Buddha Sutra. She was a devout Catholic but gingerly agreed to try it (she was pretty desperate by that stage). The next day she said she had  had the best sleep she'd had in years and continued to chant for a few days. 


Then she suddenly decided,  after 10 years of seeing the same doctor, to see a different one (I can't remember if someone suggested it to her or not) for a second opinion. The new doctor was horrified-- she'd been getting regular cortisol injections for a decade and it was ruining her health. Her first doctor had been unbelievably irresponsible.

I asked myself what the purpose of Ego and our perception is, if it's all an illusion. 






I noticed that when I fall asleep or just do things without really being aware of what I'm doing, I feel good.
Soon as I become aware of myself, of suffering, of the activities and tasks that lie in front of me, I start to attach and feel bad.



I always had the impression that to be ultimately free, one has to cease to exist. As long as we are in a state, we are subject to certain conditions. And this, for me at least, goes beyond joy and suffering. If we don't attach to anything, how can we feel joy?

And even if we remain in a completely neutral state, of just observing without judging, we would still be. We would still be connected to the state of existence.






Of course one could argue that if you don't exist, you are bound to non-existence and not free of this state, but to me it feels like this is still more liberated than a state of existence.




I don't regard ego as the opposite of enlightenment. I think most things in life are constructed as some sort of spectrum or a ring.

Ego would be in the middle and enlightenment on the outside.


But what if it was possible to even get out of this ""ring"" of possible states?



Or in easier words, let's say we have hot and cold and perceive them as opposite sides of the same thing, temperature.



What if we could disconnect from temperature?





In terms of ego and enlightenment, what if we could remove ourselves from the boundaries of being in states? Someone who lives in ego has the possibility to either stay there or become enlightened, losing his or her or it's ego, subjective state.


Someone who has reached enlightenment still perceives (and perhaps could lose it again, even though I doubt this is possible).



Something that is hot can turn cold and something that is cold can turn hot. You could perceive them as opposites, but they are still part of the same thing, temperature.






If there is nothing, there is nothing to be cold or hot, no possibility to change, just eternal non-existence.

Or maybe not even eternal, because this would be something you could regard again as one side of the spectrum.




This may be really confusing so I hope I made my point somewhat clear.







The way I see enlightenment, the things that you perceive are still possible to be judged for someone that hasn't reached enlightenment.




If a person gets killed by a tree, the subjective mind could argue that this is sad or good or whatever and the enlightened that it just is.



But what if there simply is nothing that is? No tree, no one to be killed or survive and especially, no one to observe?








Is it possible to reach non-existence (cause I think non-existence goes a big step further than death) and is there such a concept in Buddhism or other religions/philosophies etc? Perhaps like zero-summing in the Elder Scrolls universe?

Annihilation is not possible according to Buddhism because there's nothing to annihilate. Enlightenment isn't actually the destruction of the ego either, since the ego itself is a delusion. Everything you pondered in this post is simply due to assigning fundamental permanence and self to phenomena. Liberation by disconnecting from all these illusions is possible though. One doesn't have to stop, nor keep moving.

Have you studied Buddhism much?","Bob Thurman often talks about this on his podcast.

Unfortunately, nothing can cease to exist. For that to happen, things would have to really exist in the first place, and there aren't any non-relational objects out there. Beside that, you can't go into nothingness because nothingness doesn't exist for you to go *into*. It's just not there. If it were, then it wouldn't be nothing, it would be a *something*.

You've hit on an important insight, however, when you say you tend to feel fine when you're falling asleep or otherwise doing something that doesn't demand your self's total involvement, and it's only when you bring this self into things that the depression appears along with the craving for annihilation.

There's a cluster of three teachings in Buddhism which are inter-informing, meaning one informs the other which informs the other which informs the first one. They are: Impermanence, not-self, and emptiness. Most teachers will walk students through each of these topics separately and I'm sure they have good reasons for doing so. As I practice, I can't seem to see such a clear distinction between these topics because they all seem to mutually depend on one another and they've been my ""answer"" for how things (including people) *are*.

These teachings, however, are just one side of things. I like to call this the ""wisdom side"" where we find clarity and correction from the mis-knowledge of reality we carry around in our heads most of the time. The other side is absolutely vital and cannot be ignored and that's what I call the ""compassion side"" but, really, it's about all virtues (generosity, patience, etc). The reason being: Okay, so let's say you have some great insight into the ""wisdom side"" and you're left wondering ""okay so ... now what? What do I *do* with this information?"" It's one thing to feel relief from being freed from some ignorance, but that doesn't really translate to a fulfilling sense of purpose.

That's where this ""compassion side"" comes in: What we do is we cultivate virtuous attitudes, we develop a strong motivation to be of the greatest possible benefit to everyone (including ourselves). After all, knowledge isn't of much use unless you can use it for something productive, right? Otherwise, it's just an object of fascination that you look at once in a while and go ""huh, neat"" and then put it away and the Buddha's Dharma is far too precious to just keep on a shelf like an ornament.

So this is why we always pair wisdom with the development of a virtuous nature. It makes the wisdom *real*, it makes it practical, it turns it from a mere intellectual object into something useful that leads to real change.",,,,,,,,,,

You don't have to be Asian to be Buddhist.

You can be white and Buddhist. Most of Zen and Tibetan Buddhists in North America are whites.

There are large Buddhist communities in Europe, Brazil and the rest of South America. There is a growing Buddhist community in Africa.

You are not culturally appropriating when you become a Buddhist.

We don't have a Bible. We have tons of Bibles. (a huge collection of ancient texts) It doesn't mean other religions have few. It means we rarely have a complete work that can be handheld.

There are different kinds of Buddhists. Zen in Japan. (But not just) Chan and Pureland in China. (But not just) Tibetan Buddhist in Tibet. Theravada in South/SouthEast Asia.

Tibetan Buddhist is the most well known Buddhist in America right now. Largely due to China's actions against Tibet and the wondeful work of Tibetans teaching Buddhism to the world.

Zen Buddhism came to America much earlier and are well represented throughout United States with almost all its monks from the US.

Sensei means teacher. (Zen Buddhist) Lama means guru. (Tibetan Buddhist)

The sub r/zen isn't Zen Buddhist.

We are not all nice. Some are struggling to follow their faith.

Our institutions are not perfect. There are some awful ones we warn people about. From bad sects, cults, abuses and scandals that must be held accountable.

Karma is not some kind of cosmic justice system.","Praying in buddhism is not like in christianity etc., it is a way to show reverence towards Buddha. 

No-self does not mean that we do not think people really exist. They just don't have a single component storing their identity, like a soul would. The same goes for everything.

Buddhism is not about destroying the ""ego"". There is no ego to destroy, as per the above. Realizing that is a goal. 

Meditation is not the same as mindfulness. We meditate to learn to be mindful. Part of meditation can be guided mindfulness, but mindfulness of our actions, feelings and mental states should be a part of every moment. That ability is trained in meditation.

Nirvana is not heaven. It is the escape from the cycle of rebirth and redeath, from dhukkha.

Karma is not an energy. Karma means ""action"". The result is called vipaka. Bad karma = immoral actions. Bad karma leads to bad results and vice versa. This is not a system of justice, but a natural law like gravity.

If Buddhism is true (and i do have that confidence it is), then at some point in your practice, you will see the benefits of the teachings in your life. At that point, you will be able to accept the teachings in total, and likely at that stage, they will make sense to you.

What that means is subjective, so there's a big gray area there from person to person and region to region. There's a ton of overlap between branches, but you may wish to compare; 

Theravada buddhism - following the teachings of the elder buddha, such as the eigthfold path to enlightenment, like the ""orthodox"" of buddhism. 

Mahayana buddhism - emphasizing performing the actual teaching yourself to pass on these beliefs. 

Zen - emphasizes self teaching about the nature of things, emphasizing escape from distraction or negative influences and oneness with nature. 

There are many regional (and personal) variants to any religion, including buddhism. In my younger years I practiced Theravada buddhism in an environment that was hostile toward it. All I had were books and goals. Now, I'm much more of a zen style, which is more about being malleable and fluid than trying to make the world fit into your belief bubble, in my opinion. I feel zen is more relevant to my life, and I started out as a disenfranchised christian due to all the hokey emphasis on miracles and god-love. I just want to be happy, and I want the same for you.

Best first advice: find a living teacher and develop your relationship with them. The Buddha Way is not just ideas. Idea-centrism and the glorification of concepts are modern western, information-age, antisocial-media-disconnecting twists on true Dharma teaching.

The real Dharma life is much more about relationship and action than about collecting encyclopedic knowledge. One act of wisdom and compassion is better than ten thousand books.

A teacher is also incredibly important because, as a beginner or intermediate or advanced student, you need something in your life to function as a beacon -- something that can consistently maintain the pure view at times when you return to your default preference, habit, and opinion. And if that  influence can also see your nature, your tendencies, your needs, and can warn you of pitfalls, provide teaching you can trust, offer it in consistent language and within an integral course of training, and can respond beneficially to your triumphs and failures, and can provide a living example of what you aim at -- all that is so much the better.

All great masters have acknowledged the central, vital importance of their teacher to their awakening.

Once you have confirmed for yourself the trustworthiness of your teacher and the wholesome nature of Dharma, then *go for refuge*. (I.e., take formal refuge in the Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha -- and never stop taking refuge.)

You shouldn't do this before you understand what it means, but if you do it soon after confirming the wisdom of it for yourself, it will serve as the first and most important *seal* of your choices. That is, when you wander and even when you die, a firm commitment to refuge can be imprinted on your midstream and can bring you back to the Dharma in the future.

At the moment, your window is open. You see the value of Dharma and you also feel it; your aspiration and inspiration are working together.

This will not always be the case.

Until your mind becomes very stable through much hard practice, aspiration will come and go. There will be times when the mundane details of life swamp your desire to tread the Dharma path. There will be times when personal difficulties seem too much. There will even be times when you lose sight of the value of Dharma, forgetting the pure mind you are reflecting currently. Or times when your identity as 'Buddhist' or 'good student' or 'suffering practitioner' or 'know-it-all' or 'free agent beyond rules' will take precedence over plain sincerity.

So it is important to take good and decisive steps when the widow is open.

Although a few books might offer overview, basic knowledge, or occasional inspiration, *you should know very surely that the source of your Dharma is not outside of you*. You should not depend on books too much, or even on live verbal teachings. Soon they can become a hindrance; soon they can close the window to your pure 'just-do-it' mind.

448,,Buddhism,"So today, i saw a movie, where some prisoner escaping, and a traveling car takes him, until he sees a cop. And he gets out, then the car goes through the cops. And when the cop asks if they saw some prisoner running around. He tells that he saw and he run that way, and gets in the car. Thats when the very nice Buddhist grandma sitting, tells him, why did u told them, hes a son of someone, and a father of someone. And he tells what if hes a murderer, and this bitchy grandma says do good to others. 

So the point is, that grandma is going to let him escape, and kill more people, just because she is doing good to him, for her karma. Yeah, she might go to hell if she dont do good things. So shes doing all this, and killing another very happy family just minding their business, just because that bitch wanted to good for that murderer.

[https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.5.04.than.html](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/kn/ud/ud.5.04.than.html)","I used to be an avid fisherman, and there is no possible way to avoid eventually killing some fish, no matter how hard you try. Eventually one will swallow the entire hook and you'll kill it (in what I imagine is an absolutely horrifying way to die) trying to get it out, or any number of other things will go wrong that result in its death.

And there is absolutely no scenario in which killing is acceptable. It's one of a mere five actions the Buddha taught us to abstain from at the bare minimum, along with lying, stealing, sexual misconduct (rape, infidelity, etc.), and consumption of intoxicants.

There's no yardstick for measuring bad karma, but killing is on the farther side of it. 

Even fishing for ""sport"" requires a rather deliberate suppression of any sense of goodwill or compassion you might feel for other living beings.

Maybe consider less cruel hobbies to take up.","&gt; The Story of a Fisherman Named Ariya
&gt; 
&gt; While residing at the Jetavana monastery, the Buddha uttered Verse (270) of this book, with reference to a fisherman named Ariya.
&gt; 
&gt; Once, there was a fisherman who lived near the north gate of Savatthi. One day through his supernormal power, the Buddha found that time was ripe for the fisherman to attain Sotapatti Fruition. So on his return from the alms-round, the Buddha, followed by the bhikkhus, stopped near the place where Ariya was fishing. When the fisherman saw the Buddha, he threw away his fishing gear and came and stood near the Buddha. The Buddha then proceeded to ask the names of his bhikkhus in the presence of the fisherman, and finally, he asked the name of the fisherman. When the fisher man replied that his name was Ariya, the Buddha said that the Noble Ones (ariyas) do not harm any living being, but since the fisherman was taking the lives of fish he was not worthy of his name.
&gt; 
&gt; Then the Buddha spoke in verse as follows:
&gt; 
&gt; Verse 270: He who harms living beings is, for that reason, not an ariya (a Noble One); he who does not harm any living being is called an ariya. 

Fishing is wholly unskillful, cruel, inhumane and should never be done.",,,,,,,,,,

In fact, they are a hindrance to the practice. There are some benefits to psychedelics in that

 1. They sometimes lead people towards finding truth and spirituality, then they may find dhamma, which then they can drop the drugs 

2. There are potentially some medical benefits in certain contexts 

3. There are times that new perspectives gained from psychedelics can be useful. 

The problem though is, to put it simply, psychedelics are pretty unstable and their effects can be unpredictable. Through our practice we want a healthy balance of tranquility and insight. Psychedelics sometimes provide insight, often provide delusion, and rarely provide tranquility. 

There is a good reason why using intoxicants is against one of the five precepts.

Edit: I would like to add because I think it‚Äôs useful knowledge that I have extensive use with psychedelics. They provided unique experiences to me and perhaps helped lead me to where I am today, but I can say I‚Äôve learned much more from following the eightfold path and practicing meditation then I ever could have through drug use.","&gt;Or are they deluding themselves.

Yes. There are no shortcuts via intoxication. People delude themselves into thinking it's somehow a wise insight just because it's different than what they had before. Just because something is different doesn't means it's wise.","If you take the hype out of DMT trip stories, it basically boils down to travelling down a kaleidoscope tunnel until you meet robot elves at the end. This is not the goal of meditation. Even if we believe the hype that they meet angels or Gods, they are too high on drugs to really bring anything of worth back with them.

Instead of trusting in a distorted reality for insight, you should focus on reality.

FYI, I am not a Buddhist, this is just my opinion.

I think drugs will only increase attachment, not decrease; thus it would hinder, not help",,,,,,,,,,

I shared a quote by Dudjom Rinpoche not long ago, partly on the third turning, and he says,

&gt;...while the intention of the final transmitted precepts is not the same as that of the mundane Mind Only system in any of its forms, the purposes of the lower phases of the vehicle are gradually gathered within the higher, so that [Mind Only and the like] are not contradictory apart from their vindication of an extreme position. Indeed, one must truly comprehend that the great distinction of the higher over the lower phases is a feature of the precious teaching of the sublime Sugata. Otherwise, after one had been given teaching on suffering, selflessness, impurity and impermanence according to the first promulgation and everything had been established as emptiness according to the intermediate transmitted precepts, if one were then to grasp literally the meaningful intention revealed according to the final transmitted precepts concerning bliss, purity, permanence and true self, without knowing how to accept them **with an attitude confident in the four kinds of reliance**, one would engage in conceptualising thoughts which would confuse those who require training and wrongly scrutinize the teaching.

This bolded part I think is very important, because this is getting into the realm of things that are not really within the realm of disputation and debate, basically not within the realm of words really. You have to sort of 'get it' with wisdom mind, and there is a particular intention related to this. But if it is simply approached from a sort of 'mundane mind', then one will not properly get it.

[Here](https://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Four_reliances) is a bit more on the 4 reliances.","The fourth reliance is in fact to rely on jnana, and not on vijnana. Vijnana is not the same as intellectual knowledge, it is really a bit wider. It is any of the six dualistic consciousnesses that engage with supposed dharmas.

A couple years ago I [translated](https://reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/a6k8pv/abhij√±ƒÅ_vs_j√±ƒÅna/ebw65ah?context=3) the explanation of this reliance as given in the Akshayamati sutra; 84000 has recently [translated](https://read.84000.co/translation/UT22084-060-004.html#UT22084-060-004-272) this sutra, so one could read that too.","This is why I feel that practice is so important!  Anyone can read all the texts and sutras, and analyze them like a college literature class.

There's nothing about this anywhere in the teachings given by Buddhas. Accordingly it's anybody's guess what, if anything, happens in this case, since beliefs about influencing luck tend to be very inconsistent (for obvious reasons).

Next time maybe you can just ask permission and save yourself unnecessary worry.

Did the statue in question represent a fat, bald, laughing man?",Why did you try to touch it if you know your friend‚Äôs dad doesn‚Äôt let them touch it?,"Yes, in a sense it causes bad luck; but it's not a superstitious cosmic retribution. It's cause and effect, in the same way that if you are a bad neighbor you will have more difficulty in life, or if you are lazy about cleaning up you will experience more chaos and be more open to accidents, losing things, and perhaps even illness.

Touching someone's head is a very intimate thing, and it's generally a demeaning gesture. It's very presumptuous to touch someone's head -- it presumes a lot! We might do it to a child, but it would be a sign that they are 'below' us, not our equal, much less our superior. We would not do it to our boss or a stranger on the street, or even a co-worker.

Approaching a religious icon in this way shows that one already has a very glib, haughty, disdainful relationship to it. Perhaps one is threatened by a number of bad assumptions about the statue. Perhaps one resents the whole idea of respect or humility.

It is this *relationship with integrity* that generates the causes for 'good luck' or 'bad luck' -- the seeds of benefit or harm, satisfaction or suffering. **The way you relate to the highest principles of life sows either good or bad seeds, which come to fruition when they meet their precipitating conditions.**

So yes, if you have a condescending thought toward the symbol of goodness, purity, harmony, compassion, and wisdom, then you diminish those qualities in your life. You shut the door to them a little bit more with each such thought.

And if you *take action* on the thought, then that effect is increased. It is sealed now not only in the mental sphere but also the physical sphere: you have *followed through* on the thought or attitude.

This is 'luck'. It is the effects you yourself bring forth with your though and action,

But there are also mitigating factors:

Although unconsciousness is a huge, major cause of the difficulties we make for ourselves and others, it is a less blameworthy cause than conscious decisions. The mark you make on your own mind with conscious intent is much deeper. (Though unconscious habits become very deep because they are repeated so many times.)

So if you merely lack awareness, and don't know much about the culture and meaning of a statue, and are only following what other people do, these conditions might diminish the negative effect of your actions. That is, if you are generally sincere, there is probably not much harm.

But if you *maintain* your unconsciousness -- if you stubbornly refuse to learn, refuse to be aware of the effects of your actions -- or if you already know better but do a bad action anyway, then the harm you do to yourself is much greater.

The effects on you also change according to how others are affected. If you do a bad action in private and then regret it, it is less harmful than if you do it with shameless pride or in front of others. As we can see in our society these days, for example, one bad action by a famous person can incite countless others to repeat the bad action. It can soon become a feature of our society rather than an unfortunate aberration. A few lies from one person can become a culture that is alienated from the truth.

So again, it is your relationship to integrity that determines your good or bad luck. And the way you treat not only a sacred image, but *all* the objects and beings in your life, expresses that relationship.

Buddha is not just the Buddha image: Buddha is you and me, and the world we live in. How will you approach Buddha? What is your right relationship to life in any moment, situation by situation? The name for that question is *Dharma*.

.

By the way, u/bodhiquest and u/tambit are correct in their comments on the cultural side of your question.

.

You touched the statue even though you knew there was a rule against it. This shows that you gave in to some influence in you: pride, rebellion, arrogance, curiosity... what? Maybe a combination of all of these.

So yes, you can expect some negative result, though you might not recognize where the result came from when it arrives.

But you can also purify these kinds of negative results. For one thing, you can apologize, repent inwardly, and made s sincere offering to the Buddha -- incense, a flower, pure water, a candle -- something to go along with your pure and sincere mind.

Then you can offer some kind of Dharma practice effort. For instance, 108 or 300 or 500 prostrations can quickly work through small karmic bonds. Also, chanting, mantra repetition, work in service of someone else, or other kinds of generous effort can be effective -- some practice by which you sacrifice your selfishness, and feel the sacrifice.

This means that instead of just a suffering result of your bad action, you change it into the pain of Dharma practice. That is, you derive a good and useful result (awakening and transforming your character) instead of just more useless suffering.",,,,,,,,,,

475,,Buddhism,"Hi All.

Since I have started reading Pali Canon sutras and books about Theravada a few years ago, one thing has been bothering me greatly. It actually at times spoils the pleasure I normally derive from studying the sutras. It even gets to the point that I cringe a bit when reading some of the texts. It really bothers me greatly and no matter how hard I try, I just can't seem to resolve this - what appears to me as - glaring contradiction. Dharma is extremely important to me, and I will greatly appreciate any help you can offer!

Here it is:

When I read sutras that speak about here-and-now, renunciation, not being concerned with past and future, with gain and loss, with rituals, ideas, sutras about replacing unskillful desire with the skilful one, replacing unskillful pleasure with delight coming from meditation, simplicity, goodwill, generosity and wisdom, about detachment from and disenchantment with the world as not-self, ultimately unsatisfactory and transient - it all resonates with me, make sense, fills me with joy and peace.

But then I read sutras about heavens, hells, gods, different animals one will be born as depending on their deeds in this life, or riches or misfortunes in future lives - stuff I am supposed to take on faith, stuff that is not helpful at all for me in here-and-now.

So here is my problem - when I read the sutras, sometimes I get the feeling that there are at least two Buddhas speaking to me or that some of the things I read in the Pali Canon do not come from the Buddha. To make it even worse, there are sutras where Buddha directly states that one should not be concerned with the past and future lives and then - in other sutras - Buddha proceeds to paint the map of heavens and hells.

 I just can't reconcile those two worlds.

Knowing what the results of deeds done here and now could be seems relevant to here and now.

Rebirth and the realms are present in parallel in all of the earliest texts in all their versions. There is, quite literally, no alternative when it comes to discerning what the Buddha taught, except to read the scriptures.

There are not two speakers in the canon. Consider if you are the one creating the division in your mind because you have already written off certain ideas as incredulous and thus you feel that the Buddha cannot have taught them because the Buddha was so wise. If he indeed was wise, perhaps it would be best to go to his words without already having decided that certain ideas are to be discarded.

&gt;there are sutras where Buddha directly states that one should not be concerned with the past and future lives

One being whom? A person on the edge of jhƒÅna? Or a person on the edge of making a morally relevant decision?

The Buddha spoke his instructions at specific times.","&gt;there are sutras where Buddha directly states that one should not be concerned with the past and future lives

Are there? Can you share any examples?

Are you familiar, by the way, with the [Siha Sutta](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an05/an05.034.than.html)?",You put thoughts of past and future aside but it doesn't mean they don't exist.

This is also a common topic for which a rule has been made, indicating it's been talked about to the point mods are a little wary of it. A subreddit search for 'meat', 'vegatarian', 'vegan' and so on will be valuable for you. Here are a few posts that come up on a search:

* https://old.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/l3hbua/all_living_beings_tremble_before_violence_all/ -- I think this one might be instructive for you to look into

* https://old.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/l3dsxn/to_meat_or_not_to_meat/

* https://old.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/k3uxtr/in_places_like_greenland_where_indigenous_inuit/","It's not categorically. In general it is advised to avoid having meat specifically killed for you. There's the so-called ['triple clean' rule](https://www.dhammawiki.com/index.php/3_fold_rule):

&gt;I say that there are three instances in which meat should not be eaten: when it is seen, heard, or suspected that the living being has been slaughtered for the bhikkhu. I say that meat should not be eaten in these three instances. I say that there are three instances in which meat may be eaten: when it is not seen, not heard, and not suspected, that the living being has been slaughtered for the bhikkhu.

So like if a monastic was wandering into a village for alms, and the villager had some old chicken stew, this might be given to the monastic.

But if a monastic was coming to a village and the monastic saw that the villagers said, ""Oh, a monastic is coming! Let's go slaughter a chicken to give alms to them!"", this would fall under the triple clean rule.

In some Mahayana traditions there is more of a categorical emphasis on vegetarianism.","The first precept is to reduce suffering. Animals in the meat industry are not treated well and thus eating them is an implicit acceptance of those practices that intentionally cause suffering to other beings. 

2nd precept is to not take what isn't freely given. I doubt that the animals dying for our carnal pleasure are willing to freely give their lives for us.",,,,,,,,,,

Lots of info on it and encouragement.

Set a goal. Don‚Äôt do it for 1 week. Then do don‚Äôt it for 2 weeks. Then for 3 and then for 1 month. After this try a detox. Usually takes 90 days to change hardcoded mental habits as far as I have read.

So you would do 90 days and then would be much easier to cope with the urges.

Meditating when you feel urges might help. Calming down and so on. But sometimes the urge can be just too strong and make a struggle to meditate. So practice over time to stop is what seems to work.

Edit: as a helper I once saw this explanation on how to deal with it and it can be helpful too. This is a practice more on the aim to break the enchantment over porn.

If monks in the ancient community didn't encounter a certain kind of problem/trouble, no rule would be made. You can read some of the origin stories in translation [here](https://suttacentral.net/pli-tv-bi-vb-pj).

While I don't know that there is a single correct answer, several of the additional rules for nuns seem to focus on nuns who permit others to engage in sexual gratification where they aren not active participants.

Ancient accounts of travelers in classical India mention that when nuns were attractive, laypeople/non-Buddhists would sometimes attempt to lure them into sex work or concubinage. Independent women were largely unknown in ancient India- they were expected to live with their family, husband, etc.- so the independent life of a bhikkhuni offered dangers and opportunities for women that were unique to them.

So I suspect that these rules have to do with preventing opportunistic sex work under the guise of a religious life. The same conditions wouldn't have existed for male monastics, because of the different roles and power of men and women in ancient India.

Other rules seem to deal with keeping order in the community and preventing factionalism... A number of additional rules for nuns center around a nun known as ThullanandƒÅ, who may be a literary stand-in for disreputable nuns who tried to take advantage of the freedom and material gifts of monastic life. She is depicted as the 'first offender' in a lot of rules relating to nuns.","The reason **may be** in the fact that humans never simplify, rather always complicate things. That's just something we do.

In the beginning, each man had very close to the entire knowledge and all the skills and entire history of his tribe in his head. 

Over time, it got more and more complicated, and today we have hundreds of sciences and specialized fields, and now no man has the entire knowledge of his ""tribe"" in his head. 

And this process goes on and on and will never stop.

That's probably how 4 rules became 8, and if they're changed again, I bet the change will result in more rules, not less.",,,,,,,,,,,

The inner Buddha also represents our fundamental inner potential purified awareness towards recognising suffering and the end of suffering.

The outer Dharma is to me the teachings left behind by the Buddha in terms of the formal doctrine, writing etc.. The inner Dharma is when you apply this teaching and investigate and use it to reduce suffering and also identify the causes of suffering. To me the outer Dharma is for example meditation instruction. The inner Dharma is say the development of the jhanas and also when you recognise say the source of suffering.

For feelings of attachment - mediate on impermanence. 

Personally I found contemplating all the different ways that relationships can and do end to help a lot. I thought about people cheating, falling out of love and drifting apart, dying, being forced to live apart etc as well as the impact this has on people (children losing parents, people going through divorces late in life, lonely people being left with a void etc). It helped me to take my heartbreak less personally and develop compassion for other people going through similar, or even worse experiences. It also helped me realise that even if my ex hadn‚Äôt dumped me when they did, there was a strong possibility it would have ended in another way later on. 

Impermanence is a beautiful (and painful) thing. It hurts but also gives meaning. The relationship was impermanent but so is your pain. Keeping generating good karma and I‚Äôm sure something even better will find you.","I sincerely think you should not listen to the keyboard psychologists. You are heartbroken, which is something most people go through, many people, if not the majority, more than once. It will pass, but it is not nice. Luckily, it is perfectly normal and fixes itself in time. Sometimes a lot of time is needed, sometimes not a lot of time is needed. But it will go away. Good luck","Ah. She was your first relationship. Nice. It sounds like there were enjoyable aspects to it. Well done. 

I often recommend an Equanimity &amp; Kindness practice. And I think Equanimity here is good. Rationally you know you'll meet others, have other relationships, and you'll meet partners who are also very special. 

Appreciate your ex, but don't dwell on her. Send her Metta and give her up. Do not contact her. No one likes a clingy guy who doesn't get the hint. If you really would like to be open to a relationship with her in the future your best bet is to make yourself better and be cool about the breakup. Who knows in 6 months she might want to get a coffee. But often in six months you're the one not really interested. 

Hit the gym and work on yourself. Reflect. You're already reflecting, so that's good. Meet new people and make new friends. Out of this pool, don't' be too shy to ask someone out for coffee. A friend of mine told me once to expect a 1000 NO's but keep going. You won't get a 1000 NO's though. So you're ahead of the game.",,,,,,,,,,

These topics are inter-informative and can be challenging to explain all in one post, and they can often take years of practice to understand but that brings up an important thing to note: Buddhism is something to be practiced rather than understood intellectually. The analytical, intellectual mind is limited, prone to delusion, and cannot see the truth beyond itself. Through practice, however, we can have instances where we can see the truth that the teachings point to, which are beyond the limited intellect of the analytic mind.

Rebirth, for example, is a very important teaching in all forms of legitimate Buddhism. It makes perfect sense, too, it's a very rational teaching. Nothing in the universe, when it appears to die, winks out of existence. If a tree falls, it doesn't just vanish into thin air, does it? Everything is recycled. Everything becomes something else in an endless cycle that stretches across the universe. Stars are born, die, and explode and become new stars and even planets.

Everything is constantly shifting, moving, changing, because everything is connected on the most fundamental level of reality. Thus, rebirth is a perfectly reasonable teaching. If nothing in the universe just winks out of existence when it appears to die, why would human beings be the one exception?

So we are all subject to rebirth and central to Buddhism is the notion of realizing nirvana in order to escape this endless cycle of rebirth. Escaping doesn't mean ceasing to exist because, again, that doesn't make sense. It means no longer being subject to the whims of karma, which propels us from rebirth to rebirth.","I think the biggest pitfall of having a background in Christianity will be finding yourself trying to pigeonhole aspects of Buddhism into concepts from Christianity. One thing to remember is in Buddhism it's not personal. Karma/kamma is not about praise and blame or punishment and reward it's more like you put energy into the system and that influences the probability that certain things will arise, but it does not guarantee a certain result either because no one is in control and everything is connected. There are many things that we don't know and can't predict that will affect us.

There is a very broad range among different schools from interpreting things very literally, like Mara is an actual being that exists, to figuratively that Maras (yes, my teacher uses the term in plural form) are a way to distance ourselves from the hindrances and fetters when they arise by explicitly describing them as not-self. There is also a very broad range in the significance and importance of rituals. In some schools, practice involves a lot of chanting and rituals in addition to meditation. In other schools like Theravada teaching to lay practitioners, there may be a little chanting at the begging and the end, but it feels like more to set the tone than anything magical.","&gt;Can someone explain it for me

It is pretty simple. All Buddhist traditions believe in Buddhas, who are a kind of maximally wise person that also has various unique miraculous powers that result from their realizations and past accumulation of merit. Many also believe in ""celestial bodhisattvas,"" who are persons that are very close to attaining Buddhahood and thus have close to the amount of wisdom and power as Buddhas. All Buddhists also believe in devas, who are divinities that have lots of powers but not necessarily much wisdom, but who can be helpful to the practitioner through offering them protection. Those are the objects of worship and the ideal sources of guidance and instruction. Demons like MƒÅra are actually devas who happen to be mean rather than nice, or they are nature spirits (the word in Sanskrit is *yak·π£a*) who are mean. MƒÅra in particular likes to try and stop people from doing religious practice.

Buddhists traditions also share an afterlife belief: after death, persons are reborn in new circumstances, and the circumstances of this rebirth accords with deeds one has done. This cycle of rebirth is believed to have been going on in the distant past and will continue into the future unless someone becomes enlightened.

Then for other ""spiritual stuff,"" Buddhists also believe in magic. The main sorts of Buddhist magic that are common to all branches of the religion are those that involved ""consecrated incantations."" The idea here is that an enlightened being can consecrate an incantation, giving it power that later reciters can use.

That's the main stuff I think.",,,,,,,,,,

Can you recommend me some resources to learn about Vajrayana yoga and the practice of constructing mandalas?  

The meditation on yourself as the deity, or *yidam* along with the yidam‚Äôs mandala are aspects of generation stage, kyerim [bskyed rim] which is the first of the two stages that constitute what is referred to as MahƒÅyoga, classified under anuttarayogatantra, or higher yoga tantra. You will need to find a qualified teacher to learn from.  

Generation stage is found in every school of Tibetan Buddhism. Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, Gelug, etc., although each school will use different yidams that are derived from different tantras. Like the Hevajra, Guhyasamaja, Cakrasamvara, Kalacakra, etc.","Try [fpmt.org/education](https://fpmt.org/education). You need to have a good understanding of what Tibetan Buddhism is about. A good teacher will not advise you to get a Vajrayana empowerment until you have a good foundation in the basic and fundamental ideas of Tibetan Buddhism, including being very proficient at both Shamatha and Vipassana meditation practices. Otherwise, no progress will be made (in the vast majority of people) and real harm can be done, if one does these practices with selfish, non-bodhicitta motivation (even if properly empowered). 

Each School within Tibetan Buddhism has its own version of the [Lam-Rim (Stepped Path to Enlightenment)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamrim). With the Pandemic, most good teachers are now online (via Zoom or Youtube). First try to find a teacher or teachers in your area and then look for them online. (Usually, if they are online, they will have a link somewhere in their site.) Then when the pandemic is over (someday!), you can visit them in their center. 

If there are no teachers or centers near you (and investigate them fully if there are -- there are some rotten teachers and organizations out there, sadly), check out the [FPMT.org/education](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamrim) programs. Each education program has its own closed forum (for only the people in that program) moderated by qualified teacher who can answer questions. Good Luck!",,,,,,,,,,

People like to share their statues.

&gt;How do statues work into the process of working toward full understanding of the nobel truths or realization of the 8 fold path

They are artworks for devotional practice, it isn't very complicated. As is said in *Dhammapada*, one who worships those worthy of it, whether Buddhas or listeners of the Buddha's teaching, make much merit.","&gt;Serious question: What's with all the statues?

It's about refocusing: we move this way and that, going after the necessities of our daily life, but also we stray into fantasies and daydreaming. If left like that, our entire world would go astray, into a chaotic nonsense experience. 

The statues, just like prayers or meditation, help with returning the focus to what matters, puts us back on track, brings important things back into the focus, clears the ""clutter"", thus rearranging our world into a more peaceful &amp; harmonious experience.","Well, like it was said by someone a while ago, r/buddhism is open to anyone and has a huge number of users. If you are looking for serious discussions it is definitely not the best place, although sometimes you can find some quality information posted by knowledgable people. You can notice that pictures of statues, altars, and monasteries get way more attention here than actual dhamma :) That is the reality.",,,,,,,,,,

Really, all we can be certain of is that at some point we will die. Funnily enough, that certainty itself isn't really all that comforting. 

It's entirely reasonable to recognize possibly not being able to pay your bills as a problem. It's entirely reasonable to acknowledge burst pipes as an issue that needs addressing. But it's neither useful to let ourselves get swept away by worries, nor is it hellful to try and put a smokescreen up or sweep problems unser the rug. 

Shantideva says:

&gt;If there‚Äôs a remedy when trouble strikes,  
&gt;What reason is there for dejection?  
&gt;And if there is no help for it,  
&gt;What use is there in being glum? (BCA 6:10)

Buddhism doesn't really do ""comforting"" in the sense of making pretend. No matter how pious we are, and how sincere our practice is: we will all face old age, sickness and death, and in between there will be all kinds of uncertainty, discomfort, doubt and frustration. The path doesn't lead away from that (where we are, anyway). It leads us *through*. By helping us recognize all our problems are the ripening of our previous karmas, by helping us become clear the vagaries of the world and our own hopes and fears just ain't no refuge, by pointing out that this uncertainty and suffering are things we have in common with all sentient beings, causing us to become loving, compassionate and to have some equanimity. 

Especially, re that last point, as an aspiring Mahayana practitioner, I always try to see suffering and pain as instructions in kindness. It doesn't *stick* all the time, but when it does, it's a profound thing. 

Just some thoughts.",I asked my teacher the same question and she said fear is the little brother of anger and anger means basically to not want to deal with this issues.,"By recognizing fear doesn't attribute to fix the logistic.  Either you can pay the bill or you can't. Fear is not doing anything to make the course change. You don't  have choice to dodge hardship, but you have choice go through it w/o fear.",,,,,,,,,,

&gt;*Mom, I want to tell you that I love you very much. The way things are going are very heavy for me right now. Your relationship with alcohol and drugs, and your moods, make me feel very unsafe when I am around you. I am also very worried about Sister's safety and happiness and about your own. I am worried about where the situation could go from here. It is all very hard and sad for me, and I know it is for you too. I want you to know that I love and support you, and that I am here for you to fight against this as much as I can, if you want me too.*

Something like that. I don't know your or your sister's ages of course, but please don't hesitate to contact child protective services or something like that (if that's available and safe where you live and so on), if you are in any immediate hazard. Be loyal to your mom and your sister and yourself, but not to your mom's illness.

And as a piece of Buddhist advice, since you're here, don't forget the Refuge. If you like, you could recite a refuge verse like *""Namo buddhaya, Namo dharmaya, namo sanghaya!""* as a little practice. There's no more stable basis for our own benefit and that of others than the three Refuge Jewels.

Different traditions use some terms differently.

&gt; But how or what should I meditate?

There are dozens of meditation subjects. It depends on what is fitting for you accompanied by clear instructions.  
The breath is probably the most popular subjects. One good resource for this is Thanissaro's *With Each and Every Breath*. Another popular subject is mettƒÅ. There are many resources for all kinds of meditation methods around. You'll have to experiment a little or just try breath or mettƒÅ.

In general though it's about getting familiar with the instructions and practicing them, eventually settling the mind down to some extent, and clearly observing reality to some extent.

&gt; I haven't been able to find a single video that's helped me so far. 

What do you expect meditation to be like? What does it mean when you say that no video has been able to help you? Does it mean that you find the instructions unclear, or does it mean that you didn't have any unusual experiences and think that there's a problem with the method?

Which instructions did you try until now, and how long have you tried them?

&gt; I cant imagine things in my head when I think. Tell me to think of a cow and I know I'm thinking of a cow but I don't see one. All I hear is my voice in my head if that makes sense.

You might have aphantasia, or maybe you simply never used your imagination enough and need to train it. In any case this isn't always relevant, unless you want to try a visualization-based method, and even then it's apparently not an impossible obstacle.","Apps like headspace have the benefit of using simple instructions and allowing you to explore the whole spectrum of meditation techniques. This appraoch is useful for a total beginner, but I would not recommend a dependence on apps. Guided meditation is not a good idea for the long term.

You are doing fine as long as you follow instructions consistently and understand the purpose of what you are doing. A good starting point is ""With Each &amp; Every Breath""and ""Keeping the Breath in Mind"" - see the *For Beginners"" section in https://www.dhammatalks.org. If you want something more samatha (tranquility) focused, see [Mindfulness of breathing](https://www.sayalaysusila.net/ebooks/english/Mindfulness_of_Breathing-Anapanasati.pdf) (pdf) or for simple vipassana instructions - [Practical vipassana meditation exercises](http://www.buddhanet.net/m_part1.htm).

It might be helpful to find a local Buddhist center where they also teach meditation. There are some books too, if you cannot find an in-person teacher. Lack of visualization ability is not a major problem.",,,,,,,,,,,

She is ‚ÄúMama Tara"", She never takes Herself seriously. She‚Äôs a daily treasured friend, ready helper, saves us from harm, a heroine, precious guide. She always has ‚Äútime‚Äù for everyone‚Äîafter all, time is relative. She is just as quick to help the prisoner in jail as the faithful practitioner, without discrimination.

Just to make it clear what a ""mother"" is, think of an actual literal mother. She doesn‚Äôt question Her children. If we need Her help, regardless of our own blemishes, we will get Her help.

Nothing can stand before a mother‚Äôs compassion. Literally, mothers have lifted cars off of trapped children. A mother would die for her family. Tara‚Äôs love goes even beyond this level. She loves all, with equanimity.

Yes I have prayed for Her as suggested by other Buddhists at DharmaWheel.net. Someone there said, early on, you can pray and ask for anything because She wants to help beginners feel comfortable.","Tara is a female form of Avalokiteshvara revered in Tibetan Buddhism.

What do nondual practitioners mean by consciousness being ""formless"" or ""empty"" or ""boundless""? I hear this from nondual practice or philosophy more. What I take it to mean is something like the pointing exercise from nondual mystic Douglas Harding. He asks you to direct your attention to objects. They have definite forms, of finite shape and size. But when you point to your self or your face, it is not a thing. It doesn't have a shape or size in that way. Is that what they mean by empty or formless?

In the *Prajnaparamita Sutra* or Heart Sutra, it is said ""emptiness is form, and form is emptiness."" I'm still struggling with these paradoxical claims. I take it that what we humans perceive to be objects are really more a consequence of how our visual or conceptual system works. Categories aren't really ""out there"" and objects don't really have essences (Paul Bloom and other psychologists have shown even children display this essentialist thinking very early). But I guess it's kind of escaping me how that relates to nondual practice or what exactly ""emptiness is form, and form is emptiness"" means.

&gt;the pointing exercise from nondual mystic Douglas Harding. He asks you to direct your attention to objects. They have definite forms, of finite shape and size. But when you point to your self or your face, it is not a thing. It doesn't have a shape or size in that way.

Objects in fact do not have form, shape, size, until the mind simplifies the reality, i.e. whatever ""forces"" or changes happen on the other side of our senses, bundles those together, thus making simplified symbols of the reality - ""objects"". It is a matter of necessity, of economy, because beings have limited resources at their disposal which they can use to navigate the world.

So instead of ""handling"" unfathomably complicated net of interdependencies ""out there"", where every little change ""here"" changes everything else, everywhere else, and bearing in mind that the changes are perpetual and from instant to instant, the mind, instead, handles these mind-made simplified symbols. 

In the same way, your self or your ""face"" is a symbol for all the ""things"" that come together to make ""a you"". And just as we can't fathom the ""real reality"", we can't fathom the entire network of ""forces"" that manifest as a sentient being. So again the mind does what mind does: simplifies the reality into a symbol, into another ""object"", called Self, so that the sentient being this Self symbolizes can go ahead and survive, multiply, etc.","I wrote this for another topic but it‚Äôs fairly similar :

There several fixed fixed meanings of the term non-dual or more accurately Not Two used in Buddhism and hence Zen. Though the term is often mistranslated as Non-duality/Advaita the term Buddhists use is actually Not-Two/Advaya which does not reify the concept into a monism or specific substantial nature of entities.

The first use is the way it is employed in the Yogacara, consciousness only school, where phenomena are said to be produced by mind. So in this case, sights, sounds, tastes, etc. in other our objects of perceptions are not separate from the perceiving mind since both are just mind. This is referred to as the subject and object not being two.

The Yogacara then employs it in another way in regards to emptiness. Here it is said that phenomena neither possess a self nor are completely non-existent. Here not two refers to things not being under the two classifications of Self or Nothingness.

The second is the Madhyamaka use of it; where the forms of things is not separate from emptiness as emptiness is just the negation of the form‚Äôs substantial existence. It can also refer to the negation of existence and non-existence without positing any further possibilities beyond that. This is the specialty of the Madhyamaka - a non-implicative negation.

The third is its use in the Tathagatagarbha literature revolving around emptiness and wisdom. This refers to the fact that consciousness has the aspect of clarity, the capability of awareness, and the capacity to perceive emptiness while at the same time is itself completely empty and unarisen.

Another definition is in regards to meditation practice where the body and mind do not feel separated at longer Ë∫´ÂøÉ‰∏ÄÂ¶Ç though here rather than Not Two the phrase One Suchness is employed instead though the meaning is roughly the same.

Zen makes use of all of these definitions being an amalgamation of the various older strains of Buddhism.","Emptiness means **empty of self** i.e lack of an inherent self in all khandas.  

Khandas are mere khandas, not I, not me nor self.  

Form is mere form, only inverted perceptions (recognising) fools us into samsara. The body is just body, it doesn't listens to us, one cannot control it. Only due to ignorance we think the body as us or ours.  

This is really deep and subtle phenomenon, hard it is to find a person who has seen **selfless** nature in the khandas, but by following the teaching of the Buddha it can be clearly seen.",,,,,,,,,,

time I was waiting for a bus and some agitated dude who was obviously high on something was kicking the bus stop and cursing. Two women waiting got up and moved away from him. I was getting really annoyed and was going to get in his face. I thought about it and instead started playing the James Brown I had on my phone instead. After a minute or two he snapped out of it and told me how much he loved James Brown. We had a good chat and he told that he saw Prince during the Purple Rain tour and MJ during his thriller tour. I was geeking out.

None of that would have happened if I went with my earlier instinct.","Your good conduct is indeed an example for us. It is hard to be full of metta even if the abuse is directed towards others. If you were to become angry that anger would have stayed with you like a sour grape ruining the mood for the entire day. 

Since you were cultivating metta at that time I assume you're equanimious, calm and at peace now. This is the dhamma directly visible here and now and has good roots for the Future. 

What a blessing that the Buddha taught the dhamma and that the dhamma is still present in this world because of a handful virtuous people following it.","This reminded me of a few ideas. 

*Violence is forced use of force.
*Violence can be the quickest resolution of karma.
*Non violence in the face of injustice.

The first idea is that death and destruction is natural. The surface of stars, the creation of earth, the cycle of life on earth... It's rising and falling. Use of force can be done wisely, to reduce suffering. Violence is using force to create suffering. From the Buddhist view, if a person commits violence, it stems from ignorance.

The second idea was explained by a teacher of the Dalai lama... If two individuals have 'karmic debts' that they want to resolve quickly, violence may be their path. Intervening in their conflict can 'shift the debt' to you. His idea was most people don't want that, and avoid conflicts, but if you're a boddhisatva that's fine, lol.

The last idea also comes from traveling in Tibet. We visited monasteries that had been attacked by Chinese soldiers in the 'great liberation'. They described practicing non-violent thought, let alone non violent action, as you and your brothers are killed by rifle butt blows to the head. You don't try to stop the soldiers, you don't hate them, you have pity for the ignorance that leads them to violence, and reside in calm abing as your skull gets cracked open.

I always found that last example to be quite difficult to accept. Which I guess means I need to practice more.",,,,,,,,,,

514,,Buddhism,"If you're like me your brain function tends to go down when you're low on grub. So on Uposatha most of us will go for Mike n Ikes or Ghee if you're a bit strange. We end up having to crash our insulin before sitting and meditating. This isn't healthy so I decided to make an alternative that keeps you awake, while also being healthy, vegan, and flexible.

This recipe is pretty fluid and as such, you can interchange sugars, fruits, etc... 

The main thing I'm looking for is a slight stimulant, so I decided to use Green Tea. You can use whatever tea you want.

I'm also looking for Citrus since they help stave off hunger and help the immune system. I decided on Kiwis, Limes, and Lemons.

I'm also looking for some kind of strong aromatic, I chose Ginger in this situation since it tends to go well with these ingredients.

When it comes to the energy source you can also use whatever you want. Stevia is good. Blue Agave Nectar is better. Honey is great. Just try to stay away from stuff that will spike your insulin hard. In this case, I chose Honey for its health benefits. Instead of sugar, you could also use fat as your energy source, you could add butter, ghee, MCT oils, olive oil, etc....

For my 72oz pitcher, I used two lemons, one lime, two kiwis, 6 packets of green tea, 1 small to medium-sized root of ginger, and 5 tablespoons of honey.  I filled the water up to 60 oz and put the water into a pot and set it only medium. I juice each fruit and put the waste inside the water itself. I add two pinches of salt and then add the honey and wait for the honey to dissolve. Once the water starts steaming. I then pour the mixture through the strainer to remove any pulp so it stays a tonic and pour the hot water with the green tea into the pitcher. 

I let it steep for a couple of minutes and either pour myself a cup or put the rest in the fridge to enjoy later.

The drink itself is really refreshing and helps stave off hunger, colds, tiredness, and other mundane afflictions.

What I like about it is that it keeps my focus at a constant. It doesn't spike my energy super hard and peters off, or I don't get wired from an energy drink. 

While it may be less palatable, for fasting, fat is undeniably a better food source. You could also lookup bulletproof coffee if you want to do something that actually tastes good. Or try out butter tea; it would probably less offensive than bulletproof coffee and would provide the same benefits of a longer-lasting food source.

Both?? 

It is a religion, but all religions are ways of life.

&gt;and not necessarily to praise or worship buddha. 

The Buddha said that praising and worshipping the Buddhas is meritorious, though.","&gt; I've heard that buddhism is a way of life. But I've also heard that it is a kind of religion.

It simply depends on what these words mean to the speaker and to you. Buddhist texts themselves never define the Dharma as ""religion"" or ""way of life"".

&gt; I've heard that buddha is another word for an enlightened person.  

It is, but this ""Enlightenment"" or Awakening in question isn't some vague thing.

&gt; Siddhartha Gautama, the original buddha,

He is the Fully Awakened Buddha of our current time period. He himself named many Buddhas of older times, and that's only in the context of the larger division of time we're in. There have been innumerable Buddhas in earlier times, before this universe, and also across the universe or universes. There's no ""original Buddha"". You could say that he's the historical Buddha.

&gt; So my thoughts are that the end goal of being a person of buddhism is to become a buddha yourself and not necessarily to praise or worship buddha.

Becoming a Fully Awakened Buddha is indeed the goal of MahƒÅyƒÅna Buddhism.

&gt; worshipping buddha

We don't worship Buddha as Abrahamic believers worship their overlords. However, a form of worship is used in the practice. Ultimately the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas and so on that are worshiped are not outside ""ourselves"", or rather our minds. This is easy to say but difficult to realize, of course.

In the West, people usually scoff at devotional practice because they are having an allergic reaction to what they think is the same as the worship of Abrahamic religions. It's in fact a very useful and beautiful practice, and is just one of the useful tools in the toolbox.

I think that going through a good introductory text, such as *Approaching the Buddhist Path*, would help you.","The word ‚ÄúDharma‚Äù means roughly ‚Äúcosmic law‚Äù

The problem is the English language, it doesn‚Äôt have a category for something like Buddhism. Neither religion nor way of life fully encompasses what the Buddhist project is about.",,,,,,,,,,

Now Akkosaka[1] of the Bhaaradvaaja Brahmans heard [of this.][2] Angry and displeased, he went to see the Blessed One, overwhelming him with abuse and reproaches. At these words the Blessed One said: ""What do you think, brahman? Do you receive visits from friends and colleagues, blood-relations and others?""

""Yes, good Gotama, sometimes such people come.""

""What do you think? Do you serve them with solid food, soft food and savories?""

""Yes, good Gotama, sometimes.""

""But supposing, brahman, they do not accept what you offer, whose is it?""

""If they do not accept, good Gotama, then it belongs to us.""

""So it is here, brahman. The abuse, the scolding, the reviling you hurl at us who do not abuse or scold or revile, we do not accept from you. It all belongs to you, brahman, it all belongs to you! If a man replies to abuse with abuse, to scolding with scolding, to reviling with reviling, brahman, that is like you joining your guests for dinner. But we are not joining you for dinner. It is all yours, brahman, it is all yours!""

""The king and his court believe that Gotama the recluse is an Arahant. And yet the good Gotama can get angry!""[3]


[The Blessed One said in verse:]
How could anger rise in him who's free,
Wrathless, all his passions tamed, at peace,
Freed by highest insight, by himself,
So abiding, perfectly serene?
If a man's abused and answers back,
Of the two he shows himself the worse.
He who does not answer back in kind,
Celebrates a double victory.
From his action both sides benefit,
He himself and his reviler too:
Understanding that man's angry mood,
He can help him clear it and find peace.[4] 
He's the healer of them both, because
He and the other benefit thereby.
People think a man like that's a fool,
For they cannot understand the Truth.
[Akkosaka responds exactly as in SN 7.1]

And another Venerable Bhaaradvaaja became an Arahant.","One thing that helped me: after the encounter, take 10 minutes or so to reflect and see what's going on in your mind. Ask yourself what is wrong and keep asking why. Don't be content with superficial answers. The issue will be about how you view yourself. It's never about the other person.

Thoughts can be very, very subtle and there are often some things that we don't want to admit to ourselves. Some possibilities based on what I've encountered in my own life:

* The way that person dismissed me made me feel small and less than. Like I wasn't good enough. I hate to be disrespected because maybe part of me deep down feels they are right. Maybe I am worthless.
* I'm ashamed that I didn't stand up for myself and get taken advantage of so easily. Why do I fray so easily? Other people seem so strong and I feel so weak. What's going to happen next?

So spend some time with yourself and see what negative self-views and attitudes are lurking around in your mind. Whatever comes up, don't argue or reason with it. Hear it out and just let ""it"" say it's piece. Be very gentle and kind with yourself, as if you are soothing an upset child.

Good luck.","Yeah, wow! This is a good topic for me. I get triggered by rudeness and it is a problem sometimes. 

The Buddha offered a really basic remedy for these sorts of things when he explained that no conditioned phenomenon was self. One the one hand that seems like an esoteric take on identity but I like to think that the Buddha was saying, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt take things personally.‚Äù In fact that is a huge source of dukkha. Every time I feel insulted I have invited stress and sorrow into my life and often for no good reason other than habit. 

Remember Santideva:

‚ÄúIf in those who encounter me
A faithful or an angry thought arises, May that eternally become the source For fulfilling all their wishes.‚Äù

This is the model of behavior for the bodhisattva. Such a person does not wish harm rather blessings. I am not there. But I am at least willing to look at what is holding me back. What do I gain from reacting and becoming angry? Why do I give other people this power over me? Why do I judge so harshly?",,,,,,,,,,

The glue that holds a Buddhist society together is generosity  and virtue. Anybody that takes part in any Buddhist activity should be doing this from a position of generosity. Too many things in life is a zero sum game. Somebody loses and somebody wins. When the buddha creates a sangha he has this in mind. So the dimensions of how the society works is thru pure actions that are in line with the Buddhist teachings, i.e. developing compassion and goodwill. Without generous and virtuous people, monks and nuns cannot eat. Without generous volunteers in the Buddhist community certain things wouldn‚Äôt be able to be accomplished.

532,,Buddhism,"The 20th century Vipassana movement might be confusing to beings who want to follow Buddha's teachings. So I am sharing a couple excerpts from Ven. Dhammavuddho who explains the role of Samatha and Vipassana as taught by Buddha in the suttas. Notice the difference from what is often taught nowadays.

Role of Samatha and Vipassana.

Charity (dana) and morality (sila) are the positive and negative aspects of doing good. Likewise, samatha and vipassana can be said to be the positive and negative aspects of spiritual practice. Samatha, which results in the attainment of jhana, is the positive aspect which brings one closer to Nibbana, jhanas being halfway stations to Nibbana. Vipassana is the negative aspect, because one sees everything in the world as it is with proper wisdom thus: ‚ÄòThis is not mine, this I am not, this is not my self‚Äô ‚Äì‚Äì as a result, one will naturally withdraw from and let go of the sensory world. In other words, samatha meditation pulls one towards Nibbana, in contrast to vipassana, which pushes one away from the world.‚Äù

We find in the suttas and vinaya that there were several instances where external sect ascetics who had practised samatha, upon hearing the Dhamma for the first time, attained liberation or Arahanthood. So what is the vipassana ingredient here? Anguttara Nikaya 5.26 mentioned below gives us the answer ‚Ä¶ the vipassana ingredient is listening to the Dhamma, and would also include teaching, repeating, and reflecting on the Dhamma. Thus vipassana should be translated as contemplation, as translated by the Chinese over a thousand years ago, and not insight, as is commonly translated nowadays.

Spiro from a used book store.  This study of contemporary Burmese buddhism found that 73% of male lay buddhists and 56% of female lay buddhists aspired to nibbana as the result of their practice.  The majority of the other choices represented either rebirth as a wealthy and/or influential/powerful human, as a weikza, which is apparently an eternally young/immortal being whose power is achieved through alchemy or some other form of magic, or a deva.  I should note however, that even when nibbana was chosen as the preferred goal, the vast majority of people involved in the study did not understand nibbana at all, and they assumed and believed it was some form of an eternal superparadise.  It appears that all around, basically every single person would choose some form of hedonistic or pleasure based rebirth.  Only about 225 people were queried, if you're interested.","They care but know that it is very difficult for most people to reach Buddhahood in their lifetime.

The Vedas are very old and predate Buddhism.  Hinduism post-dates Buddhism, and emerged out of earlier Vedic religions. 

Buddhism emerged out of a Sramanic context, and bears more similarity with Jainism than Hinduism or Vedic religion. The other major Sramanic religion of the time was the Ajivika, who emerged out of Jainism directly, but believed in determinism over karma. 

The Vedic religions were prominent to the east of the Buddha‚Äôs country, around Vaisali, while the Sramanic religions dominated Magadha, Kosala, and Sakya. You can read more on this and the religious landscape of the time and area in Johannes Bronkhurst‚Äôs *Greater Magadha*, an excellent text that puts to rest this colonial myth that Buddhism and Hinduism have any real or direct relation with one another. While they would engage in polemics, this occurred centuries later and different parts of the continent.","As far as I'm aware he was never actually involved in Hinduism at all.

It is more so that there is ultimately no separate self as an entity which possesses those traits. The self is a mere construct which is only those traits, and so on. In actuality however, those traits do not truly construct an entity. The entity or self is inferred, and we use that inference as a tool for engaging with and navigating experience, but we mistake that inference to be a referent, meaning we become entrenched in the nexus of conditions and come to view the self as an inherently real entity.  

The actual meaning of selflessness in these teachings revolves around the non-conceptual, direct realization that there in fact is no inherent self, or any self at all for that matter. This results from recognizing that there is no thinker of thought, no separate feeler of feelings, no seer of sights, no hearer of sound, and so on.  

Here is Sera Khandro, a prominent 19th/20th century practitioner discussing the self:  

&gt;&gt;*A literal definition of the term ‚Äúindividual‚Äù is as follows: The two obscurations, along with habitual patterns, fill an individual‚Äôs stream of being; and the contaminated aggregation of attachment forms the foundation for the individual. What is called ‚Äúthe self‚Äù is the consciousness predisposed to assume the existence of a self: during the periods of waking life, dream, transitional states [bardos] between lifetimes, or in a future life, a self merely appears when none exists. That consciousness is what is called ‚Äúan individual self.‚Äù Immediately thereafter, subsequent knowing and discursive thought give clarity to the consciousness predisposed to cling to an ‚ÄúI‚Äù where there is none, and a sense of self where none exists, and make them stable and solid.*","All that you claim as you is empty. Meaning it dependently arises. Essentially, there is no aggregate of self without relating at least two parts together. Without this relation, self means nothing. And since we can‚Äôt whittle down to a core piece that is ‚Äúyou‚Äù it is said that it is ‚Äúnon-self.‚Äù

That isn‚Äôt to say there isn‚Äôt inherent enlightened nature that resides in all of us to essentially be realized. But that realization, nirvana, is outside of definition and can‚Äôt really be put into words beyond saying it is unconditioned or independent; not dependently originating.",,,,,,,,,,

539,,Buddhism,"Every Recitation Is at the Moment of Death; Each Is Embraced by Amitabha Buddha; Each Assures Rebirth

By Master Jingzong

How do we comprehend the ‚Äúmoment of death‚Äù? Our life is only one breath away from death, for exhaling at the present moment doesn‚Äôt guarantee we will inhale again. The ‚Äúmoment of death‚Äù can happen after any breath. Thus, every recitation links to the last breath of life; each recitation is at the moment of death.

In general, we expect the ‚Äúmoment of death‚Äù to be a certain time far in the future. But who is to decide when that point in time will be? Frankly, any present moment can be the ‚Äúmoment of death‚Äù: Suppose you were on the way to a business meeting, and you got into a car accident, and that became your ‚Äúmoment of death.‚Äù  You might have plans for 10 or 20 years into the future, but things might not go as planned. Therefore, any moment can be the ‚Äúmoment of death.‚Äù Every one of our recitations is at the moment of death.

The light of Amitabha Buddha permeates in every direction. Why does it embrace only Amitabha-reciters and never forsake them? That‚Äôs because the Buddha sees vividly that every one of our recitations could be at the last moment of life. What if Amitabha had said, I would come fetch you when you are in need or encountering vicissitudes? It would be too late.

The Buddha-light embraces and never forsakes reciters because beings are facing death at all times. As Master Shandao says, ‚Äúsentient beings are prone to jump into the fire pit of the Three Wretched Realms;‚Äù we may fall in at any moment. No matter what, Amitabha Buddha will never let go of reciters, so how can we fall? The Buddha tells us, ‚ÄúEvery one of your recitations is at the moment of death; each of my thoughts is to deliver you; each recitation ensures your rebirth in my land.‚Äù

Here is a quote from Master Shandao: ‚ÄúEvery recitation with a committed mind achieves rebirth in the Land of Bliss.‚Äù ‚ÄúA committed mind is a sincere mind, a profound mind, and a mind of merit-dedication towards rebirth. One, whoever gives rise to these three kinds of mind, his rebirth is assured. After that, every recitation ensures rebirth now, not in the distant future. Otherwise, it would be an incorrect view of impermanence, a weak perspective of life. 

Shakyamuni Buddha once asked his disciples: ‚ÄúWill each of you tell me your understanding of life and impermanence?‚Äù

Some disciples answered: ‚ÄúLife is within seven days.‚Äù

The Buddha replied: ‚ÄúNo. you do not understand,‚Äù meaning the disciple was not yet enlightened, and did not understand the reality of life.

Some disciples said: ‚ÄúLife is impermanent; it is within a day and night since I do not know if I will live tomorrow.‚Äù Their answer seemed to show a better understanding of life.

However, the Buddha replied: ‚ÄúSon, you do not know the Way either.‚Äù

Another disciple answered: ‚ÄúLife is a short while.‚Äù It was getting close, but still not quite there yet.

And the Buddha again replied: ‚ÄúNo, you do not understand. Because ‚Äúa short while‚Äù still is a measure of given time, perhaps a quarter of an hour.

Finally, a disciple answered: ‚ÄúLife is impermanent; it is between inhalation and exhalation.‚Äù

The Buddha nodded in assent: ‚ÄúYes, you understood,‚Äù meaning this disciple understood the impermanent nature of life. We breathe every day, and every breath is at the moment of death.

yes, but you just can't eat it until the next day if you are following the 8 precepts if it's given to you after noon.

As far as I understand monks take whatever is genuinly offered to them under any context....but I am not sure and want to make sure I am not breaking precepts.

This is only relevant if you are ordained and observing the rules of the Patimokkha. Monks also can't keep food at the monastery, they must eat what's given in that meal. I'm assuming your house has a fridge you could put the food in.

&amp;#x200B;

Why not just tell your friend? If he can't handle Buddhism, call it intermittent fasting... which... it technically is.","&gt;As far as I understand monks take whatever is genuinly offered to them under any context....but I am not sure and want to make sure I am not breaking precepts.

No monastics don't eat [after noon](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/ariyesako/layguide.html#chowtime) even if someone offers them food.","IMO Allowing others to encourage donation is good thing, take it. You can still donate that to someone else, if you don't want.",,,,,,,,,,

&gt;When I became a novice Zen priest, my teacher, the late Zenkei Blanche Hartman, looked me in the eyes and said in a quiet grandmother voice, ‚ÄúYou are a student of the Buddha, and he only wanted one thing.‚Äù She paused to make sure I heard what she said. ‚ÄúHe only wanted us to see.‚Äù   
&gt;  
&gt; Then she spoke of the basic goodness of others. This is what she said she saw in humanity. The teaching was so simple, but difficult for me to take in. Then again, all of Buddha‚Äôs teachings are simple and difficult. What goodness was she speaking of? With all the horror in the world, the basic goodness in others seemed to be something of a fairy tale, or empty hope. 

\[...\]

&gt; Years later, after sitting and sitting and sitting and ‚Äúbeing good,‚Äù I discovered that the goodness she spoke of wasn‚Äôt about behavior. One who receives or tries to follow the vows (even if they are not ordained) isn‚Äôt suddenly a ‚Äúgood‚Äù person. We don‚Äôt follow the vows to please each other, or to be better white people or better black people, or to be better people in general. Living the vows doesn‚Äôt even mean you have to or can accomplish anything, or that you can teach folks to be good people if you have been sanctioned to teach. 

\[...\]

&gt; It wasn‚Äôt until I officiated my first Jukai ceremony‚Äîlay initiation for students‚Äîthat living a life of vows came into full view. \[...\]  It was difficult to stop crying during the ceremony as I said these words: ‚ÄúAbiding according to the ten grave precepts, even after realizing buddhahood, will you continuously observe them?‚Äù To which the initiates replied: ‚ÄúYes, I will.‚Äù Hearing their devotion to awakening, I was deeply moved to stand at the gate and usher in those who want to live free, filled with love, and be protected from harm in doing so. 

\[...\]

&gt; Throughout life, awakening is cultivated through our conscious vow to be that person who does not cause suffering and freely walks in peace. In this way, we can all live a life of vow, enthusiastically, without reason, and perhaps without knowing each other‚Äôs name.

Because of eating so little my backside became like a camel's hoof. Because of eating so little the projections on my spine stood forth like corded beads. Because of eating so little my ribs jutted out as gaunt as the crazy rafters of an old roofless barn. Because of eating so little the gleam of my eyes sank far down in their sockets, looking like a gleam of water which has sunk far down in a deep well. Because of eating so little my scalp shriveled and withered as a green bitter gourd shrivels and withers in the wind and sun. Because of eating so little my belly skin adhered to my backbone; thus if I touched my belly skin I encountered my backbone, and if I touched my backbone I encountered my belly skin. Because of eating so little, if I tried to ease my body by rubbing my limbs with my hands, the hair, rotted at its roots, fell from my body as I rubbed.""

547,,Buddhism,"I have an electric incense heater called the ""Golden Lotus"" that is in the form of a stupa.  There are quite some metaphorical symbols on the heater .  On the base is a cloud collar.  Inside the clouds are a symbol of what I think is either a bird or a bat with perhaps a pine tree in the negative space but I really do not know.  Does anyone have some knowledge they would be willing to share on this particular cloud symbol?  Thank you!

yes, I've heard great things about that book, and I'm sure it's a good starting resource.

You know you could solve this by just dispensing with any notion of beings ""deserving"" anything.

Buddhist ethics has no need for some conception of ""justice."" If it did, how could we be asked to generate such great compassion for the beings in hell, to the point where some bodhisattvas (like K·π£itigarbha) are regarded as having actively made vows to save the hell beings? If we really were supposed to think about any particular being ""deserving"" their circumstances, we should look upon hell beings and think ""serves them right for doing bad deeds that lead to hellish rebirth.""

But that isn't what we are taught to think, and so it seems there is little room for notions of anyone ""deserving"" anything in a moral sense.

-

Note that this doesn't preclude Buddhists from believing in legal entitlements as conventions of their society which should be followed. It just means they have to explain the reasons for following those laws not based on some conception of the entitlements being real descriptions of what people deserve, but rather based on what would result in a harmonious society.",Karma is more akin to a physical force like gravity.

my personal opinion: it doesn't matter if you tattoo yourself or not. it's not going to advance nor inhibit your spiritual journey either way. if you like tattoos, go for it, but not because you think it will make you a better buddhist. it's like shaving your head or growing out dreadlocks. it's almost a spiritual status symbol, but it's only significance is what you attach to it in your own mind.",Thanks to everyone for the input and insight on this.

556,,Buddhism,"The Itivutakka is a book present in the Pali Canon in the Khudakkha Nikaya ( literally the collection of Suttas that are not part of the standard Four Nikayas but also contains one of the earliest substratum collections like the Athakavagga ). 

It is a very interesting collection in that traditionally and in terms of orthodox it is wholly attributed to Khujuttura, a servant of Queen Samavati who unlike the other 500 ladies in waiting was free to come and go out of the palace. She was also famously studious in listening to the Buddha and conveying back His teachings to Queen Samavati. Since the Buddha mentioned Khujuttura quite late in His ministry and Samavati was earlier one can assumes Khujuttura survived the burning down of Queen Samavati‚Äôs palace. Since also the Buddha seems aware that Khujuttura was in fact relaying His teachings to Queen Samavati and seems to be aware of its accuracy He must have heard Khujuttura recite it at some point.

Khujuttura‚Äôs recitations however would not have been somethings monks ( or for that matter nuns ) would have felt they needed to hear or learn in the lifetime of the Buddha so would not have been preserved by them. Khujuttura was not mentioned in the first council so it cannot be there either. Khujuttura‚Äôs recitation however clearly survives till today meaning it survived the burning down of the palace with its 500 women whose sole knowledge of Buddhism was through this.

So do we know who preserved it? We know that Khujuttura must have survived the burning as well we have the Itivutakka and we also know she is mentioned late in the Buddha‚Äôs ministry. We know that monks and nuns would unlikely find the Itivutakka something they would preserve ( at least in the early period ). 

So who preserved a collection of Suttas that seems to only have been householder to householder for sometime?

Don't know why you think this is true. Lots of suttas offered to laypeople are present in the basket.

Don't know why you think this is true. Lots of suttas offered to women are present in the basket, plus some given by women (e.g. Therƒ´gƒÅthƒÅ).","I cannot address any of your other questions, but I hope that you will appreciate my comments here.

&gt;We know that the early compilers would not have like to say a collection belonged to women ( they were highly patriarchal ) without any reason

With all due respect, I can think of at least one reason why even patriarchal/misogynistic people might make such an attribution even if it was not true: the idea that the Buddha's words were so inspiring that even women, despite their other alleged defects, were preserving and admiring them.","I know it's gauche to point out spelling errors but it's Itivuttaka.

It‚Äôs pleasant to look at, but also humble. I‚Äôve taken the view that shrines are symbols to remind us of the qualities of the Buddha. Doesn‚Äôt need to be grand, rare, or expansive.

I also like that the elephant was a gift from your brother. A symbol of his generosity and kindness. Books seem to be popular, too. To me, they symbolize the learning that takes on the path, and again, kindness and generosity in terms of the author‚Äôs efforts to share their wisdom.

Is there additional symbolism in your share that you would be willing to share?","This is a nitpick, but I think the elephant and devotional deva should be rotated toward the Buddha, rather than away, so they appear to be honoring/praising him.

They‚Äôre not facing him, but they‚Äôre oriented to face toward the center.

In The Buddha's Words was an anthology of texts from these Four Nikayas, so it's up to you whichever one you'd like to explore deeper into.

The Digha Nikaya (Long Discourses) are long texts that are usually very comprehensive and contain some sort of narrative. This one, however, is not translated by Bhikkhu Bodhi, but is part of the same collection by Wisdom Publications.

The Majjhima Nikaya (Middle-length Discourses) are... well.... middle-length texts that usually cover a specific topic each. Some of them are comprehensive, and most of them contain some sort of narrative.

The Samyutta Nikaya (Connected Discourses) are shorter texts that give overviews of topics from varying perspectives. So you can have something like 50 discourses in a row that are all very similar to each other, each one talking about the same exact subject but changing the perspective or using different parables etc.

The Anguttara Nikaya (Numbered Discourses) are also shorter texts that mostly explain the teachings using numbered lists, as in stuff like ""Bhikkhus, there are five qualities of a holy man, what are these five?"" etc.

Most people recommend the Majjhima to start with, as it strikes a good balance between simplicity and comprehensiveness, but it's ultimately up to you.","Since you've read the anthology I would suggest going with the long discourses to drill deeper. However, the middle length is not a bad choice.

Check also test of the talks, there is huge power in them. You need a good friend on path, consider this Bhante as your friend, just for now."," I want to tell you something that you might not have realized: that's how strong you are. It is great courage for someone to find Buddhism in a culture that screams mostly the opposite of Buddhism. It seems you are still very young and much wiser than I was. In this young age most people‚Äôs mind and emotion are still tender yet you have faith in your belief.

Buddhism is not a practice of strict rituals. Buddhism is the practice of liberating our mind. One of the key aspects of Buddhism is non attachment. The word is so simple and can be interpreted in so many ways. Let me try to explain it in my unperfect, and limited way:

We are surrounded by our own reality. In this reality we have a goal like most people have goals in their life. It could be a career or spiritual goals. In spiritual goals, no matter how complicated they are, most people will boil down into happiness and peace inside oneself.

How do we reach that goal?

The Buddha realized that our life is full of suffering. So he gives us some tips to teach us that all suffering comes from the outside that makes contact with our six senses. (5 physical and 1 mind). He also teaches the basic five precepts so we do not add suffering to others and oneself. This one is to sharpen our moral and loving-kindness. If our action is good, we have to accompany with good intention too. That's all we need to start our journey to be happy. 

However the Buddha also understands that our hearts are full of defilements. Ex: We try to do good but deep down our heart says the opposite, or other people do not appreciate our kindness. Those create even more suffering in our mind. So He teaches us not to worry too much if we are not perfect as long as we keep trying, simply do not attach. We do not attach to those things; those are only reality when visiting our six doors (senses that I mentioned above). At the beginning our doors are only flimsy fabrics, moved by a gentle wind blow.  

You see if there is rain, you can stop them, but you can use a jacket or umbrella to protect yourself. Being upset and cursing to the rain, will not change the weather. One day you have no jacket or umbrella, so you for sure will be wet. That you can‚Äôt change, but you can be wet and happy, instead of wet and sad or mad.

But wait. If we are not attracted, then we can‚Äôt attach to happiness too?

If you truly want to liberate your mind, then yes. But most people are tripped in this wrong mind set. We are still babies. If we are barely able to stand and we want to compete in Olympic track and field. First liberate oneself from the bad thing by clinging to the good thing. When you are safe, you too can let go of the good thing. If I be abel to let go only the bad things by the time I die then I am already 100% better than I am now.

That is my simple way of non attachment. My mom had been vegetarian for more than a decade. When she first started. She did not announce it to the world. At home she eats vegetarian, but sometimes she eats with other people. Like most Asian ways of dining, there are few dishes in the center of the table where everybody shares. So she only ate the vegetable parts, and not the meat. When people noticed and asked she told them, but let them know that they should not make a special treatment for her. At the beginning, some teased her or told her not to be a vegetarian. But with her humble way she remains, and also tells people that there is no need to order a special dish for her. Nowadays when family or friends know that she is coming, they are willing to prepare certain dishes that are vegetarian. She made her mind vegetarian, and her body will follow. 

I hope my simple and un-perfect way could help a little.",,,,,,,,,,

One must also generate wisdom, to penetrate, contemplate, and fully comprehend the detriments of fulfilling our temptations. Only then will one not need to apply concentration to resist, but resistance will happen naturally and easily.

Like if one were to see one's favorite candy on a table; one would have to apply a force of will to not eat the candy. But, what if that candy had been dropped in the toilet a little while ago. Knowing already, ""This candy is dirty from the toilet, and shouldn't be eaten,"" one does not even need to apply a force of will, but through the knowledge of the dirtiness of the candy, one already is free from the temptation of eating it.

So too, when one can find the inherit unsatisfactory nature in temptation, one need not apply force to resist; instead, avoidance happens automatically.",Really cool,"Gosh I love this.

1) Object: anything belonging to another human being or a group of human beings.

2) Perception: One perceives the object as belonging to another human being or a group of human beings.

3) Intention: One decides to steal it.

For example, many people truly believe His Holiness the Dalai Lama is an incarnation of Avalokiteshvara, the Buddha of compassion.

I just read a book where a teacher recognized one of his young disciples as an incarnation of the Buddha manjushri. 

I would be very surprised if incarnations of Buddhas were not manifesting as teachers or ordinary beings on this earth. I think we have the karma to recieve incarnations, but maybe not a full blown manifestation of a buddha yet. 
Hope that makes sense. 

Incarnations are different from full on Buddhas. They are aspects of a buddha manifest in human form on earth.","It's my understanding there can be only one Buddha (while the dhamma is known).  Read: next Buddha (Maitreya or otherwise) will not come about until the dhamma has been lost. 

Arahants are a different story.  That said, proclaiming enlightenment can be quite contentious (and virtually impossible to prove) so the assumption would be that they go largely unidentified.

All living things live through the consumption of other living things. We are inseparable from the web of life. There are more bacteria living in and on our bodies than there are human cells in our bodies. Billions of bacteria and cells are born and die every day, consumed and recycled endlessly. This is life.","I don't think it's healthy to fall into extremes. Those are dead ends. If you can figure out how to live without killing anything every, congratulations. I do live by a no-killing policy in a practical sense. I don't kill anything that is clearly alive, such as insects, etc. 

idk","Panatipatta veramani sikka padam samadiyami.

This is often mistranslated as killing of living things.

However what it actually more accurately translates to is, ‚Äústriking down of that which breaths.‚Äù

Now remember the Buddha had no concept of respiration etc.. ( or if He did it was not something that would be understood by the people at the time ). What He had was a concept called breathing ( ie:- expanding lung, closing lungs, or opening gill, closing gill ) or something that can clearly move in front of you ( as it is assumed that it had some breathing mechanism since only things that can move autonomously in His time was able to breath )

Now remember the Buddha nor His contemporaries did not think that living = breathing ( as understood in 5th century BCE, not 21st century CE ). The Jains like the Buddhist considered plants to be alive, yet Buddhism gave no protection to plants while Jains did. The Jains considered non visible small creatures to be living, something the Buddhist also did but gave no consideration to them ( remember the Metta suttas seen and the unseen .. the unseen literally means Gods and ghost, not small creatures )

So literally when the Buddha‚Äôs first precept was set up.. it was directed at humans and animals ... not plants, not microscopic beings, not fungi etc..

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Now another consideration to take is why animals and humans have special consideration, while plants do not.

It is in short .. sentiency.

The reason we do not kill animals and humans is simply .. we get reborn into animals and humans.

We do not get reborn into plants, we certainly do not get reborn into fungi, we are unlikely to be reborn into bacteria.

In short, the Precept only protects sentient beings, not non sentient.",,,,,,,,,,

1. Emphasis on aiming towards samyaksambodhi rather than ≈õrƒÅvakabodhi (whereas in TheravƒÅda the emphasis is reversed and only a few aim for samyaksambodhi).

2. A semi-docetic view of the Buddha's life story, since he is considered to have been at least somewhat enlightened already prior to the descent from Tu·π£ita (whereas TheravƒÅda Buddhists think that the descent from Tu·π£ita was a normal birth).

3. A belief in trikƒÅya theory (whereas Orthodox TheravƒÅda works only speak of two bodies of the Buddha, and do not describe the second as an emanation from the first).

4. The belief that the difference between a ≈õrƒÅvakabuddha and a samyaksambuddha is related to the latter having destroyed both the regular defilements and also some additional ""cognitive obscurations,"" which are destroyed by knowing things to be ""empty"" and realizing something called ""the womb of the TathƒÅgata,"" which is basically the qualities of Buddhahood. Then in different MahƒÅyƒÅna denominations the meaning of those things may be slightly different.

5. A belief that there are still-teaching Buddhas in other world systems, and that by doing buddhƒÅnusm·πõti concerning those Buddhas, beings can cultivate the karmic conditions to take birth in those world systems. This is *similar* to the common aspiration among TheravƒÅda Buddhists (especially Sri Lankans) to take rebirth at the time when Maitreya is teaching in *this* world system, only these aspirations are spatial rather than temporal because these Buddhas are held to be still around *right now*.

-

These are the main doctrinal points in the MahƒÅyƒÅna texts, as far as I am concerned, which make separate it from the various ≈õrƒÅvaka sects, including TheravƒÅda.

-

Contrary to popular belief, a ""deification"" of the Buddha is *not* one of these differences, because the transcendence-from-humanity and worthiness-of-worship of a Buddha is something that both MahƒÅyƒÅna and TheravƒÅda Buddhists traditionally accept.","&gt; Edit: I think may take a slightly different directions.

&gt; The Basic Points Unifying the TheravƒÅda and the MahƒÅyƒÅna is an important Buddhist ecumenical statement created in 1967 during the First Congress of the World Buddhist Sangha Council (WBSC), where its founder Secretary-General, the late Venerable Pandita Pimbure Sorata Thera, requested the Ven. Walpola Rahula to present a concise formula for the unification of all the different Buddhist traditions. This text was then unanimously approved by the Council.

One of the most profound things about the teachings are that they‚Äôre rooted in causation. The theme of cause and effect runs through every teaching because it applies to everything in life and everything we do. 

The Buddha‚Äôs path is a gradual training. You can‚Äôt build a house by starting on the second floor. First the foundation needs to be developed.

&gt;‚ÄùThe gradual training begins with the practice of generosity, which helps begin the long process of weakening the unawakened practitioner's habitual tendencies to cling ‚Äî to views, to sensuality, and to unskillful modes of thought and behavior. 

&gt;This is followed by the development of virtue, the basic level of sense-restraint that helps the practitioner develop a healthy and trustworthy sense of self. The peace of mind born from this level of self-respect provides the foundation for all further progress along the path. The practitioner now understands that some kinds of happiness are deeper and more dependable than anything that sense-gratification can ever provide; the happiness born of generosity and virtue can even lead to rebirth in heaven ‚Äî either literal or metaphorical. 

&gt;But eventually the practitioner begins to recognize the intrinsic drawbacks of even this kind of happiness: as good as rebirth in wholesome states may be, the happiness it brings is not a true and lasting one, for it relies on conditions over which he or she ultimately has no control. This marks a crucial turning point in the training, when the practitioner begins to grasp that true happiness will never be found in the realm of the physical and sensual world. The only possible route to an unconditioned happiness lies in renunciation, in turning away from the sensual realm, by trading the familiar, lower forms of happiness for something far more rewarding and noble. 

&gt;Now, at last, the practitioner is ripe to receive the teachings on the Four Noble Truths, which spell out the course of mental training required to realize the highest happiness: nibbana.‚Äù","This does not sound like a person who is open to it even though it might benefit them. Maybe some day in the future you could get them to read a book or come to center for meditation instruction but that time is not now. Use the teachings in your own life to the best of your ability and if you want to teach what you passed on to others there are plenty out there who seek the information and who are open to receiving it. You could actually help someone in that situation instead of fretting about someone who for now is just unreachable. If your unreachable friend sees how the qualities you talk about help you in your life, they will then come to you for help if they need it. For now leave them alone and maybe do metta practices for them.",,,,,,,,,,

We do generally agree that we live in a degenerate age, and that the dharma is declining. Most schools of Buddhism hold to this idea, to greater or lesser extents. But we also believe that the monastic sangha has been able to preserve the Buddha's teachings, and that awakening can be achieved through practice.

*However*, as Mahayana Buddhists, we also believe that it is impossible to attain the state of a Buddha at this time, which is the goal of our practice. So if it is not possible to attain supreme awakening here, what is the Great Awakening spoken of in zen traditions? It is the attainment of the *path of no-more-learning*, where a disciple has completely extinguished the outflows leading to involuntary rebirth, as either an arhat or a bodhisattva of the 8th bhumi for which Buddhahood is imminent.

After a bodhisattva attains the 8th bhumi and dies, particularly through a direct method such as zen, a *massive* amount of karmic merit is still necessary to attain full Buddhahood in another world system, which is why nearly all zen masters go to Amitabha's Pure Land, to be born in the highest grade of birth, pay homage to the Buddha and mahasattvas, and then tour through various Pure Lands, doing the same, serving Buddhas, and accruing the merit necessary for awakening.

Those of us that do not attain awakening in this lifetime also devote our merit and training toward a Pure Land birth, where we'll be reborn in the lower grades of Sukhavati, and then eventually can enter that world and train in the dharma directly under Amitabha Buddha. Meanwhile, in this lifetime, we commit to and continue our practice here, and progress as far along the path as we are able.

The masses adopt the Pure Land methodology of practice, which may take the form of just recitations, or may involve dual-practice Pure Land/Zen methods where recitation and visualization are used together in the practice of buddhanusmrti in order to cultivate samadhi, which in turn results in kensho and possibly visionary experiences of the Pure Land or Amitabha.

&gt; Also how come there seems to be so much sectarianism as it relates to Pure Land schools and harsh division between them?

Japan had a weird history when it came to Buddhism.

&gt; I've seen some Pure Landers say if you've ever slandered Dharma once in your life, you're going straight to hell

Err... no, the texts don't say this at all. They say that if you slander the dharma, you won't go to the Pure Land. Along with that restriction, those that commit the five weighty offenses that lead to immediate hell rebirth also cannot be reborn in the Pure Land. You may be conflating those together (this restriction is written out as a single line, so it's easy to conflate them together).

&gt; I've seen others say that isn't the case at all, etc.

Shin Buddhists tend to focus on positive messaging and ""entrusting the vow"", but when you get down to Shinran's actual exegesis, it does line up with the mainland tradition. He has a lot of focus on Other-Power, but generally, when he says all will be reborn in the Pure Land, he's saying all that have awakened bodhicitta (which he says comes from Amitabha's grace). This indicates that those that have not awakened bodhicitta are not reborn in the Pure Land, but for Shinran, this doesn't need to be stated, because if you have faith, you're all good. For the mainland traditions, this unwavering faith is indeed the path to the Pure Land as well, and for those who can acquire it, it is assured. However, we come from the other perspective, where this unshakable faith must be cultivated through practice. We see it as a call-and-response sort of thing, where our practice puts us into a *sympathetic resonance* with Amitabha Buddha, and the response comes in form of an empowerment (adhistana) that invigorates practice and results in kensho and bodhicitta.

So really, the difference between the exclusive-practice Japanese schools and the mainland traditions, if you look at it carefully enough, is just the frame of reference that each is looking from. There isn't really any contradiction.","The most common pure land practice revolves around Buddha Amitabha, who made various aspirations as a Bodhisattva, it's said, that make it so that his pure land is sort of uniquely accessible. The general idea, for the most part, is that you orient your mind towards Amitabha/Sukhavati and by doing so you will take birth in Sukhavati after you die. This is basically speaking largely practiced via recitation of the name of Amitabha, in various forms, although there may be more to it than that. Then, you will basically have perfect conditions to complete the path fully.

There have been other pure land traditions, I believe at least related to Akshobya and Maitreya, but generally speaking when we talk about Pure Land traditions it's related to Amitabha.

With that said, although this might be the basic idea, I think there are various layers of understanding that one may have.

It is sometimes thought that in this 'degenerate' time it is very difficult to practice the Dharma properly, and it's considered that this approach is sort of uniquely suited to our times.

As for sectarian polemics, I think people are people, and generally this occurs in many different types of 'schools', not just pure land.","From my perspective of *Jodo Shinshu/Shin Buddhism*, yes, we are living in what the Buddha prophesied would be ""the Age of Dharma Decline"" or *mappo.*

Shin eschews all self-power methods that claim to lead to enlightenment. This is why we do not meditate for *spiritual* reasons (although some Shin people meditate for *secular* reasons of centeredness, calmness, etc.). This is why, as soon as a Shin person thinks that his/her meditation will lead to enlightenment, s/he is no longer practicing Shin, but has landed back in self powered practice.

Instead of relying on meditation and other self-power methods, Shin solely relies on Amida (Amitabha/Amitayus) Buddha's ***Other Power*** (as opposed to our own self power) providential grace and merit, which alone assures our salvation - salvation in Shin meaning not forgiveness of sin, but rather fulfillment of our original Mahayana aspiration toward Buddhahood. 

The Buddha issues the Call to Shinjin or perfect faith and echoes it in us, since we as ""bombus"" in this degenerate age cannot achieve Shinjin by self effort. Rather, Shinjin - called ""a raft from the Other Shore"" - is the promissory note of taking our next birth in Amitabha's Pure Land, where His grace and merit cause our hitherto ""dormant"" Buddha Nature to spark and flourish, and we ourselves become Buddhas.

Shin has no self power practices, but it does have two others: *Nembutsu* recitation and deep listening.

*Nembutsu* \- ""Namo Amida Butsu"" / ""I take refuge in Amida Buddha"" - is not a meditation, nor does it gain merit or enlightenment for the reciter. It's simply an expression of gratitude, said with a faith that is perfect because it comes directly from the Buddha. 

Deep listening is openness to the sutras and teachings of the Shin masters, as well as sensitivity to Amitabha's presence in ourselves and the world.

Shin does not attack fellow Buddhists who are still practicing the ""difficult path"" of the holy sages - the path of self powered meditation. But Shin does teach that there is an ""easy path"", which is simple reliance on Amitabha. In Shin there is no gradual, arduous climbing of ""Mount Enlightenment"", with occasional slippages back down the trail - sometimes all the way back down to base camp, to be followed by further, repeated arduous climbing back up again. Amitabha Buddha has already ""been there, done that"" ***for*** us, and we simply, humbly, rely upon His merit to lead us into His Pure Land.",,,,,,,,,,

not really. The belief that you'll be somewhere permanently after death (ie. annihilated or locked somewhere) is a belief just like believing in reincarnation. Nothing in this world is permanent, it's typical for people to automatically assume they are. The Buddha shows us this isn't the case through his teaching on the 5 aggregates. The 'solid' self is broken down into conditioned phenomena like anything else.

The antidote to being scared of death is accepting it. Sure it's a tough pill to swallow, but you'll  notice a healthy approach manifesting the more you face it head on. The Buddha's Dhamma is all about dealing with death (continuous death too). The fact that we die and are separated from everyone we love is one of the reasons the Buddha encouraged us to overcome the dreaded process.

The Buddha taught us that we've already lived and died an 'inconceivable' amount of times in the past, yet here you are. Imagine facing death 100 lifetimes ago, you were worried about the same things as in your post.","[Gate, gate, paragate, parasamgate, bodhi svaha.](https://thebuddhistcentre.com/system/files/groups/files/heart_sutra.pdf) 

Try and find the ‚Äúyou‚Äù that is going to die. It is a consistent thing? Or is it always changing? Always dying and being born. Is there anything, when you really examine yourself, that you could call ‚Äúyou‚Äù or are there just pieces of this world that you‚Äôve identified yourself with?","Recognising the danger that you are in is a necessary first step to be able to start discerning and understanding the nature of your existence or the nature of the problem.

That inevitable possibility of death which is present right now, needs to be kept in mind, so that you do not get lost in careless activities. You should certainly have a good amount of concern about it, so that you can live a life which is intune with reality, rather than a life which tries to deny the obvious.

You will die and just the thought of that is suffering for you, how much more suffering will you feel when you begin to die, when that which you feared starts to arise and consume all your escapes routes by which you used to cope with your suffering.

The presently arisen fear of future death, indicates to me right now that I am suffering right now and therefore even if my greatest fear of death or rebirth into hell have not arisen right now, I can know that when it does, I will suffer because right now i am suffering and subject to it and have not brought suffering to an end. But if I end suffering right now, i will also end all future sufferings, therefore let me remove the present cause of suffering, rather than find a way which will help me live and cope with suffering.",,,,,,,,,,

No-Mind has some specific meaning, and it isn't the same thing exactly as having a completely emptied mind.

A fully absorbed mind, concentrated onto a single object, to the exclusion of all other objects, is the goal of particular forms of meditation. This is not the same thing as No-Mind, but it is the practice that results in samadhi, or meditative absorption. This skill, which is attained through the power of *concentration*, is part of the training to cultivate the direct seeing of the emptiness of all phenomena.

In zen methodology (which is where this concept of No-Mind comes from), the idea is to cultivate that experience of direct seeing again and again, to ""see your Original Face"", which is No-Mind, in order to understand the natural state of the mind when it does not hit an object, and then there are a series of orally transmitted practices one goes through in order to actualize the embodiment of these realizations through one's actions, speech, and thoughts.

But Eckhart Tolle is not a Buddhist, he just borrows Buddhist concepts, and I think if you want to practice Buddhism, you should throw that book away and study Buddhist texts.","No, I would not say the goal is to empty the mind, as much as perhaps to realize the emptiness of the mind. This is not the same thing.","Not really.  That is a huge misunderstanding among practitioners throughout centuries.  Having no thoughts is the side effect of enlightenment not the goal.

You have all been quick to answer my concerns in regards to the dhamma from the very start - I don‚Äôt know where my understanding would be without you guys. 

My goal is to ordain. I‚Äôve been given the wonderful opportunity to stay in a monastery here in my country for 6 months. My ultimate goal is to ordain in Thailand but it might be a while until flights are back on (I wouldn‚Äôt be opposed to ordination here depending on how my stay goes - however there is a particular teacher in Thailand that I wish to ordain under).

This is all assuming that I stick with the path and that the teacher grants me the going forth. But I‚Äôve never even been on a retreat - or lived away from home. I have fear that I may not be able to do it, that I may cower and resort back to my old ways, that I may be overcome by worldly desires, that I may give up and go back to the comfort and ease of lay life. 

Having said that, ordination has been my goal for the last few years - never in life had I had a goal that I wanted to achieve so strongly - I sincerely wish to fulfill it.

I know that there will be hard times. Even if I give up very early on, it would break me that I gave up. If I continue on the path, I know that there will inevitably be incredibly hard times. So whatever the outcome, there will be hardships regardless.

I have a few thoughts that I often think about and may refer to especially when it gets tough: Staying in the monastery won‚Äôt kill me; Being in a monastery is the best place to be in samsara - it is INCREDIBLY rare - and it TRULY has your best interest at heart; If someone were to offer you a deal of being stabbed by 300 spears everyday for 100 years in return for arahantship, you should take it.

I leave for the monastery very soon. I won‚Äôt be browsing this subreddit much longer. So I just wanted to say a last thank you before I go. Genuinely, thank you to everybody who has commented on my posts and to those who have corrected me when I‚Äôve been wrong so that I can have a better understanding. Thank you to those who have shared their knowledge with others.

It could be that I give up within in the first week/s. I may be back on here very soon. But I hope I‚Äôm not. I hope that I do not give up.

just don't gossip, who cares if other people don't like it. If you actually perform at your job then that's what should matter.

You don't have to 'go at throats', but if someone is underperforming they're underperforming. You obviously have a business to run. Point being you can be assertive without being aggressive. Just look at it objectively and if the people underperforming don't like you telling them that then it's their problem and you go elsewhere.

If you operate your company well, virtuously and take care of your customers, that's the best protection against competitors. There will always be competition trying to throw you under the bus or sling mud. 

from the Dhammapada:

    This has come down from old, Atula,
    &amp; not just from today:
    they find fault with one
    	who sits silent,
    they find fault with one
    	who speaks a great deal,
    they find fault with one
    	who measures his words.
    There's no one unfaulted in the world.
    There never was,
    	will be,
    nor at present is found
    anyone entirely faulted
    or entirely praised.","The ‚Äúold, toxic, self‚Äù isn‚Äôt old at all, it‚Äôs your karmic seeds resting and sprouting in the conditioned consciousness, so there aren‚Äôt two mindsets‚Äî only you suppressing the underlying karmic momentum here right now. This karma surfaces one way or another and is either reinforced by more momentum (through habitual tendencies) or is allowed to exhaust and be liberated.","Contemplate impermanence... that despite what you do and the efforts you make, one day things might not go your way anyway, and you might lose your job, your status, your career, your possessions. We cannot control the external world and we can even think just to the global financial crisis or covid to see that there's a possibility of the world changing whether we like it or not. Then all of our material things will be stripped away.

Contemplate the mass of stress and suffering that this attachment to material things is causing in your life.

https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.013.than.html for me this link was very helpful in first recognizing the stress that I didn't know was there.

We have to be wise. So slowly incorporate your practice into your everyday life. It might not be wise to make radical changes if we're only begining to learn about Buddhism, because those things then might not be sustainable.

It depends what your goals in your life are. If your goal is material things, then there are causes of that that you can pursue. If your goal is spiritual fulfillment, the there are causes of that that we need to work on and make a joyous effort in, in order to bring about the result.

These causes of joy and meaning in our life are generosity, kindness, wisdom, having a good heart, and working with our negative emotions like attachment to material things, selfishness, greed, and anger.

It depends on you. From a Buddhist perspective, engaging in these good human values (virtuous acts), will DEFINITELY bring about our own happiness and joy and wellbeing in the future. On the other hand engaging in negative actions (e.g. selfishness) will definitely bring about our own suffering. That is due to the law of cause and effect and karma.

So we need a little bit of faith based on reasoning and understanding to appreciate that. Even though we might get some short term benefits of being selfish, in the long term it will harm us. Even though we might get some short term material losses from generosity, and virtuous acts, in the long term it will definitely being us happiness and fulfillment.

Another thing someone wise once said was that we can try to radically change our inner mind, while remaining normal in our external appearances and behaviour. But that's something I'm not too familiar with and might be like an advanced practice. Maybe someone has better information about that.

No need to sell yourself short. You actually are making progress.

See here: In order to know you are not being mindful, you must be mindful. Previously, before you did meditation, you weren't mindful enough to know you were not mindful; now you are mindful enough to know you are not mindful. This is a step in the right direction.

In order for you to improve, you must give us more information about your exact meditation practice. This is an important part of the exercise, because being able to describe every moment of your own meditation (after the fact) is a measurement of mindfulness. Though, it's important to point out that that doesn't mean you should be trying to memorize everything that happens; that's different and not what should be happening.

Instead, just describe what you do, what happens when you begin your 10-20 minutes, and what happens when you end.","Formal meditation doesn't necessarily transfer over automatically, especially at only 10-20 minutes a day. In Tibetan Buddhism, for example, there are specific practices for ""post-equipoise"", i.e. the majority of the day when you're off the cushion, and there are also practices that we're encouraged to do at six different times of the day. The idea is to make your effort continuous.

Also, mindfulness is useful, but is not the be-all end-all of meditation. Why are you being mindful?","&gt;How can I improve this?

In addition, the Nyingma school has some ways of explaining how the Nine Yanas function together. Mipham Rinpoche may be good to look into for this.",,,,,,,,,,
596,,Buddhism,"Hi All,

I am looking for some advice. I live in the UK and I am in the process of setting up a side income by selling used books. Largely these would be sought locally, asking in local newspapers whether people have used books they would like to sell.

I planned to sell on Amazon FBA, which is essentially Amazon prime. However, I now have reservations relating to concerns people have raised about the conditions of the warehouses, and more broadly in supporting Amazon as a company.

I have thought about some pros and cons but I feel I need wider input, particularly from a Buddhist perspective.

Pros- 1) It's recycling old books that are not wanted anymore, 2)People are able to make some money off used books which they otherwise may have not sold, 3) I am creating work in the warehouses and employment (which is perhaps good given covid unemployment) 4) Not so much a pro per se but, what happens in the UK warehouses are not going to be anything like as unethical as the supply chains of so many food, clothes, general product companies, so can I really say supporting amazon is any worse than supporting so many other brands.

Cons- 1) Since selling on Amazon supports the company, it can be argued that I am supporting the companies concerning corporate structure and worker treatment etc. Could it be then that this constitutes wrong livelihood? 

Any thoughts would be much appreciated.

Just being alive does some damage in some manner.

I'd say pick your battles and understand you can't save the world, but you can do what you can do in your own way.

Life is essentially a trade off. Decide for yourself if you can live with your form of trade off and don't let the opinions of others decide for you.

Only you know deep down the purpose of what you are trying to do, if you want a modest livelihood recycling books and amazon has to be the distribution...that is understanble...if deep down you want to make a lot of money by utilizing the amazon platform, this is rooted in wrong..and really you are just a extension of what makes amazon bad...

...Yes you can't avoid all impacts, but you can avoid unsustainable impacts. And anyone who says otherwise should ask  ""are you putting the right effort into this because there are alternative routes""...I don't believe amazon or a majority of their practice is ethical or sustainable to society...It is simply a buiness that takes advantage of the Human tendency of ""out of sight, out of mind"" it is hard to get people to care for other people if they never see them...especially the workers of the business ...

That being said, Amazon is not a ethical business, but the work itself you are involved in is...This makes a difficult to answer situation...I would consider it a gray area, not idea to help amazon distribution, though what's the alternative for the business? The fact you contemplate this is great, you should always ask yourself this question maybe your business is on a ethical standpoint today, maybe it won't be in 5 years...Contemplate The good and negative always...",,,,,,,,,,

I know this isn't what you want to hear here, but take this as a valuble lesson: Do not allow your relationship's stability to be based upon external validation. 

You were completely right that these could be completely normal problems thst could have been overcome together, but because an external wedge was driven into your relationship by the instructor it was not given thr chance to heal.","With all due respect, I am baffled why you or your boyfriend would allow a martial arts instructor (not even a religious leader or a parent to you or your boyfriend) to determine whether you are compatible with your boyfriend. My thought, though, is that your boyfriend's letting a martial arts instructor control him to such an extent is an indication that he has serious problems with determining when and from whom to take advice. Perhaps you dodged a bullet, as it were, by having the relationship end.

In any case, writing as a man who once offered to abandon the Three Jewels in favour of Roman Catholicism in an attempt to keep a relationship with a woman going, I understand your pained sorrow.","Gosh, no disrespect to you but your martial arts instructor sounds very unqualified.

606,,Buddhism,"My parents have always been a very judgy couple. They find it fun to point out people on the street and judge them. I grew up thinking everyone did this and it made me incredibly anxious. After finding Buddhism and learning more about it, I wanted to find a better way of not judging people. My way is to look at someone, let my initial thought and judgement make it's point, and then I will ask myself, 'Are you sure?'

For example: Earlier today I was walking home from the shop with a bag full of shopping. The city I live in isn't the nicest and it's very built-up. I live in a housing estate in England. I was walking past an old abandoned pub that my parents used to go to and there were two men sitting on a concrete block outside in the empty car park. The men were wearing tracksuits and were drinking Tyskie, a Polish beer, out of a can. I could not tell if they were sharing the beer, but I think they were.

My initial thought was firstly a slight sense of fear. Only slight. But growing up in an area like this, people day drinking sometimes leads to violence. Next my mind went to accusing these people of potentially being violent without any indication whatsoever. Then my mind went to calling them lazy, sitting on a concrete block drinking beer in the day time instead of doing something with their lives.

Then I asked myself, 'are you sure? Are you sure you know what they're doing?' and even if I did, why should I care?

Next my mind went to a thought of something completely out there, something I would never have thought about before. I thought, 'What if they're celebrating something?' Perhaps they very rarely drink. It could have been the first beer they have had in years and they were celebrating. They met in the sun to sit on a concrete block and share a moment together as friends, brothers or even as partners. I realised then that I had no idea why those two men were doing that and because I did not know, I could not judge. I was creating a story in my mind using barely any information and projecting them onto these two strangers.

Once I realised this, I realised that me judging them with fear, anxiety, disgust or even happiness, was pointless.

Thank you for reading!",t2_4owo66p9,False,,0,False,How I'm learning to stop judging and show compassion to all - including people I would usually disregard,[],r/Buddhism,False,6,misc,0,,,False,t3_ls7gxh,False,dark,0.97,,public,28,1,{},,,False,[],,False,False,,{},Misc.,False,28,,False,self,False,,[],{},,True,,1614291277.0,text,6,,,text,self.Buddhism,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My parents have always been a very judgy couple. They find it fun to point out people on the street and judge them. I grew up thinking everyone did this and it made me incredibly anxious. After finding Buddhism and learning more about it, I wanted to find a better way of not judging people. My way is to look at someone, let my initial thought and judgement make it&amp;#39;s point, and then I will ask myself, &amp;#39;Are you sure?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example: Earlier today I was walking home from the shop with a bag full of shopping. The city I live in isn&amp;#39;t the nicest and it&amp;#39;s very built-up. I live in a housing estate in England. I was walking past an old abandoned pub that my parents used to go to and there were two men sitting on a concrete block outside in the empty car park. The men were wearing tracksuits and were drinking Tyskie, a Polish beer, out of a can. I could not tell if they were sharing the beer, but I think they were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial thought was firstly a slight sense of fear. Only slight. But growing up in an area like this, people day drinking sometimes leads to violence. Next my mind went to accusing these people of potentially being violent without any indication whatsoever. Then my mind went to calling them lazy, sitting on a concrete block drinking beer in the day time instead of doing something with their lives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I asked myself, &amp;#39;are you sure? Are you sure you know what they&amp;#39;re doing?&amp;#39; and even if I did, why should I care?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next my mind went to a thought of something completely out there, something I would never have thought about before. I thought, &amp;#39;What if they&amp;#39;re celebrating something?&amp;#39; Perhaps they very rarely drink. It could have been the first beer they have had in years and they were celebrating. They met in the sun to sit on a concrete block and share a moment together as friends, brothers or even as partners. I realised then that I had no idea why those two men were doing that and because I did not know, I could not judge. I was creating a story in my mind using barely any information and projecting them onto these two strangers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I realised this, I realised that me judging them with fear, anxiety, disgust or even happiness, was pointless. It would only cause me suffering and, in turn, cause future suffering because I would think less of these people. It was ignorant of me when I was younger to project these made up stories onto strangers to make myself feel better than them. In the end, that&amp;#39;s what it was, it was making me feel better than them. If I was having a bad day, or if I felt that I was being lazy, I would say, &amp;#39;Well at least I&amp;#39;m not as bad/lazy as them.&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to share this here to hear your thoughts. How have you changed in this aspect? I&amp;#39;d love to know. It&amp;#39;s difficult to combat my habit energies, which I always tell myself from the teachings of Thay, but some of the best things in life are difficult.&lt;/p&gt;

607,,Buddhism,"Yesterday, by stroke of luck, I came across my stolen vehicle, and called the police.

It was recovered and the person, who seemed homeless, was taken into custody. I said I didn't want to press charges, but I think they had outstanding warrants or were on probation since the police seemed intent on taking him in.

I honestly feel horrible and don't know what to do. I was so attached to this vehicle and the idea of ownership and expectation of it being a part of my life, that I caused many problems for this person. I did consider approaching them and telling them to return it before the cops arrived, but I feared aggression. Again, living in ordinary feelings of fear.

Right now I'm seriously considering finding this person and giving them the vehicle, but I'm not even sure that would help anymore.

What would you have done? Should we just accept having our vehicles stolen and whatever the consequences are?

For example, if my pet had an emergency, I would not be able to help without my vehicle. But then again, my attachment to  my pet and my desire to protect him and expectations that he will be healthy are perhaps the real issue.

Rewarding this man's bad behaviour by giving him a car may encourage him to steal more, leading to a worse karmic outcome for him. 

You may have done something good for this man indirectly - he may go to jail, overcome an addiction, get an education, and live a better life. 

You don't know what the outcome of your actions will be - only your intentions. And that might be what bothers you. Don't be ashamed of being human, feeling possessive, having fear. None of us are enlightened yet, and we're only expected to live good lives according to the dhamma - with wisdom as well a love and compassion.

Generosity has a benefit according to the recipient. Giving to an appropriate recipient (e.g., an enlightened monk) is better than giving to someone who may have no gratitude. If you're going to give, give to a worthy cause.

Be well.","The laws are there for a reason. Everyone knows since childhood that you don't take what doesn't belong to you.

Your attachment to your belongings, or not, is a separate issue from this person taking what does not belong to him.

That doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't help the person out or not. That should be a separate issue as well and not motivated by guilt over his condition in life or guilt over being attached to your car. 

You are not a bad person for calling the police neither are you necessarily a good person for giving him your car, or a meal, or whatever.

Give, or not, from the purity of the giving, free from attachment to what you think you ""should"" do and also free from attachment to the results of your giving, or not giving.

Don't be disappointed if you don't get a thank you or if he trashes, or sells, or burns the vehicle the next day. 

But also don't be overly proud of yourself if it motivates him to change his life, get job, and be a productive member of society. 

It is doubtful that would occur, but the point is, to give with a pure heart absent attachment to the outcome.","If someone steals something, they are responsible for the results of their unskillful actions. This is why the Buddha urges us to not steal. It has bad consequences. You don't have to have malicious intentions towards someone in order to call the police and reclaim your property. 

You may want to check out the [Sigalovada Sutta.](https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.31.0.nara.html) The Buddha gives lots of advice on good conduct for lay people. Here's one part..

&gt;""There are, young householder, these six evil consequences in sauntering in streets at unseemly hours:

&gt;(i) he himself is unprotected and unguarded,
&gt;(ii) his wife and children are unprotected and unguarded,
&gt;(iii) his property is unprotected and unguarded,
&gt;(iv) he is suspected of evil deeds,
&gt;(v) he is subject to false rumours,
&gt;(vi) he meets with many troubles.

Notice that it mentions that one of the consequences of sauntering in the streets late at night is that one's possessions and family are left unguarded. It doesn't say ""Just let people steal your possessions and harm your family"". It's saying don't go out late at night and thus leave your things unguarded. Wandering mendicants are expected to largely give up their possessions, but not lay people. Lay people are urged to provide *voluntary* generosity to mendicants and the poor.",,,,,,,,,,

Pretty sure TheravƒÅda Buddhists don't think this, because they usually teach momentariness.

&gt;No object appears at all, and therefore nothing dissolves (unborn)

That...is not exactly what unborn means. It means that causal relations are not mind-independently real, so speaking of this being a cause of that only makes sense with reference to delusion. Thus, for the Buddhas, there is no origination or birth of anything, and for sentient beings, there is dependent origination.","I think a key takeaway of the teaching of Dependent Arising is: *since all that arises, arises in dependence to conditions, cessation is thus possible, through the cessation of the contributing conditions.*

This can basically be appreciated as an argument to support the possibility of nirvana (cessation of dukkha and samsara), which is what the 4 noble truths are largely talking about. 

1) There is dukkha. 2) Dukkha arises in dependence to some causes/conditions. 3) With the cessation of these causes/conditions, there will be cessation of dukkha, thus nirvana. 4) This is the way (8fold path) that leads to nirvana.

There are also more elaborate teachings of Dependent Arising, like the twelve nidanas, which supposedly those of the pratyekabuddhas-vehicle contemplate on to realise their awakening. 

.

&gt;1. Object arises, it stays for while, it dissolves.

I'm not sure if this relates much to the teaching of Dependent Arising. Might be more related to the idea of momentary citta, but not sure if we can consider the momentary citta an object, because it's probably more like the momentary citta taking things as its object instead.

But this is a subject I'm not familiar with, so maybe those more learned can share about it more accurately.

.

&gt;2. No object appears at all, and therefore nothing dissolves (unborn)

The unborn is more like a pointer to that which is so-called unconditioned, to help the practitioner drop all dependencies and reliances and craving and clinging, to arrive at the so-called original mind. Kind of like what the zen school people call - turning back the light.

I guess there's some relation of it to the implication of Dependent Arising, but I don't think understanding of Dependent Arising is needed to realise the so-called unborn. So I won't say it's a level of understanding of Dependent Arising.",Neither of them are correct understanding of dependent arising.  There is no way you can contemplate co-arising with a single object.,,,,,,,,,,

613,,Buddhism,"22M here. Last year in August, I had a huge crush on a girl that rejected me because of my creepy/needy behavior. I've also told her best friend some embarassing things me I've done as a child. The crush turned into an obsession without me knowing it. I decided to start studying Buddhism in order to find peace of mind and forgiveness within myself, so I vowed not to do it again. I've had the motivation to regain peace of mind, but something once again got to me and once again I've went to an untrustworthy woman and told her all the problems that have happened to me, plus I confessed that I was obsessed with this chick. I am very disappointed in me for betraying myself and I am feeling suicidal. I don't know if there is a way out, because I feel so exposed and I've done it myself. I never learn from my mistakes.

**121.** Think not lightly of evil, saying, ""It will not come to me."" Drop by drop is the water pot filled. Likewise, the fool, gathering it little by little, fills himself with evil.

**122.** Think not lightly of good, saying, ""It will not come to me."" Drop by drop is the water pot filled. Likewise, the wise man, gathering it little by little, fills himself with good.

Life is a process without immediate gratification. You will probably make similar mistakes multiple times before you are able to identify the issue and make slow and steady steps towards change. In order to do this, you HAVE to have compassion on yourself as if you are another person, as if you were someone else you love and have compassion for.

If you have trouble with compassion for other people, some compassion meditation will help: [https://www.lionsroar.com/how-to-practice-tonglen/](https://www.lionsroar.com/how-to-practice-tonglen/)

Self compassion comes when you realize we are all made up of our genetic predispositions + life experiences, and we all only know what we know when we know it...that is all we know and all we have to work with. Every single person on earth is in pain, suffering like you, but there is a way to alleviate the suffering. Faith in this will get you through until you see the results, faith that the bucket of good you are filling with compassion and faith will eventually be filled with goodness.",,,,,,,,,,

It's just a language game, and a petty one at that. 

Impermanence isn't a phenomenon in itself, but just a label of a common characteristic of compounded phenomena. Or if you wanna be real nitpicky about it, the word impermanence is a label for the conceptual label for this common characteristic. Both the word and the label are, obviously, dependently originayed and impermanent (I forget about impermanence all the time, myself). Even without labeling it as such, compounded phenomena would still be impermanent, though.","How is impermanence permanent? This just seems like semantic games, but is not logically tenable.

Just because impermanence is valid and true in all cases does not make it ""permanent"". It is a negation of permanence, not a thing in-and-of-itself. It's an incoherent argument.","The late-classical and early medieval SautrƒÅntika metaphysician-epistemologists addressed a related question which probably sets down the solution to this problem as well. That question is how a Buddhist should answer the [problem of universals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_universals). They took the nominalist position.

I would guess that having taken that position, they would hold ""impermanence"" in the sense of a property thought about over and above particular things does not actually exist, and thus is itself neither impermanent nor permanent, so the criticism misses.",,,,,,,,,,

After doing a Tai chi class I went into meditation and as soon as I closed my eyes I was in a rice field and this other guy was there, in a distance, with a small hut in the background.

He points to the table and I seat down, he offers some food and drink but he doesn't seat nor eat.

I don't work crazy hours.","I am a geriatrician who is going to do more advanced post graduate studies ( in the country I practice geriatric medicine is a specialist training of internal medicine akin to gastroenterology, whereas in the US it is a branch of family medicine so it is quite confusing to explain to people )

Work life balance really is how you make it ... do not expect work life balance though UNTIL you finish speciality training ... just FYI. After that .. you are in some control so work life balance becomes possible. 

I see medicine as an extension of Buddhism. The Buddha did say that he who wishes to serve him should serve the sick. I am constantly reminded of sickness, old age and death, which means I am deeply aware of anicca. I also integrate mindfulness practice at work. Also when I am annoyed by some patients I actually practice loving kindness.",,,,,,,,,,,

I‚Äôm still a musician, just don‚Äôt play or practice on the posadha days.

My tradition doesn‚Äôt expect full time commitment to the 8 precepts. I‚Äôve heard some do, but many do not.","I‚Äôve upheld them for several weeks at a time, and for many Uposathas, aside from the times I‚Äôve observed them on retreat.

My big takeaway was seeing, when one is abstaining from certain things (especially sexual activity, in my case), just how quickly and easily the mind is carried away by sensory experiences.

Sense restraint and mindfulness become truly vital, because a sexy commercial on television, for example, or even a stray thought can quickly snowball into lustful states that make upholding the precepts difficult...

Which is maybe the point of the whole thing, and the big lesson: I started really noticing just how susceptible my mind was to casual bits of input from the environment, but also, vitally, that I had within me an ability to restrain it from being carried away; to catch it before it starts careening off in some random, potentially unskillful direction. I didn‚Äôt *have* to be a slave to the whims of my mental habits, if only I could put in the hard work of *just doing the practice*.

And since one is abstaining from basically all non-Dhamma-related diversions during this period, the only pastime one is left with (aside from studying Dhamma and listening to talks or whatever) is just watching the mind do this little dance, bouncing from arising thoughts and urges one the one hand, and the skillful directions I‚Äôm trying to incline it towards on the other. Every single one of the factors of the Noble Eightfold Path become hugely and obviously important.

It‚Äôs still really challenging to do outside of monastery/retreat settings (and even inside them), but it‚Äôs an incredibly valuable experience every time.

Edit: pinging /u/PotentPaliPotables, since they‚Äôre also a long-time musician who may have some unique input for you.","&gt; How long have you upheld these precepts?

About three weeks, but not continuously Week 1 for 5 days, Week 2 for 3 days, Week 3 for 4 days so far.

&gt;How did your life change after taking the additional 3?

Great deal.  
I do not constantly pulled by craving (eating too much, sex, watching useless YouTube videos, and so on)  
I listen to a lot of Dhamma Talk or read. I just transcribed good Dhamma talks that I like.  
I do not get sleepy during the afternoon, even when I spell less than normal.  
And the craziest thing is cure my low blood sugar. Even doctors constantly tell people who have low blood sugar to eat a little bit of food throughout the days. I used to get a headache and feel bloated within 5-10 minutes after I felt hungry, if I didn't eat. I ended up eating too much to compensate. Sometimes I felt headache too if I eat too much.   
In the first week I still take little food, the one that is sanctioned by vinaya, like sunflower seeds and prunes. But the purpose is not for you to get full. So I ate slowly. I still got headache on the first few days, but got better.   
In the second week I just felt very little headache on one day, but on the third day I did not eat at all after lunch. I still felt hungry but I am fine.  
In the third week. I get used to not eating after lunch. Even though I felt hungry I did not get a headache or bloated. 

&gt;What are the difficulties you face, if any, in upholding the precepts in daily life?

Food was the hardest at first, but if I continue probably entertainment in general like sport. I hope I can maintain 3 or 4 days a week. But also when COVID is over, the situation might change too.

&gt;What made you do it?

I let five baby rats died. I found baby rats, so I put them inside a bucket with some food. I also build some kind of contraption with food and ramp for the mama rat to get into the middle and fall down into the bucket.  The idea is to release them in some remote park. However, after a few days the mama rat did not show up, and the babies died.   
So I took the eight precepts for five days, one day for each baby, and transfer merit to them, and ask forgiveness for my action. I hope they can be reborn in better realms. Sadhu sadhu sadhu.",,,,,,,,,,

Our whole mental apparatus is based on *avidya*, unawareness, so it's sorta unavoidable that the truth sounds paradoxical (or even nonsensical) to us. Which isn't to say that just being contrary or paradoxical for its own sake is particularly useful, of course.

- being.
- not being.
- both being and not being.
- neither being nor not being.

It is used because it's a traditional way in Indian philosophy, and because:

- Each alternative is mutually exclusive (that is, one of, but no more than one of, the four statements is true) 

- All the alternatives are together exhaustive (that is, at least one of them must necessarily be true).

&gt;they like to use this language.

&gt;X is not existence, but X is also not non-existence.

The reason being in Emptiness of phenomena, that ""it appears yet doesn't exist, doesn't exist yet - appears"".

""It"" only appears to truly exist, but on close inspection, we see the ""It"" is not there. The ""It"" was only imputated by the mind, on inspection we find that the base on which ""It"" was imputed - was empty; there never was the ""It"" there.

Maybe, like seeing a man in tv, say Governor Cuomo: he talks, smiles etc. But when we look closer, it's just dots of light on a glass screen and membrane of the speaker making air waves. ""Governor Cuomo"" was made up by the mind.

The same is with all phenomena. They appear in mind like real things and beings, but when we ""look closer"", it's all just thoughts and memories...",I guess it's because the final destination is impossible to put into words.,,,,,,,,,,

Of trust or Love or effective communication in my family.

I realized that my parents DID love me. The also felt shame about me.  And they struggled to SHOW love. They felt it, but they couldn‚Äôt show it without yelling or telling me that my needs didn‚Äôt matter.

it shouldn't make you cringe. It's an opportunity to reflect on the wisdom of the Buddha's teachings. Since you haven't been able to stop dwelling on the past abuse, the hostility isn't stilled. It's there. If you were to focus on your breathing for 20 seconds, you'd have no thoughts of past or future, there is peace there. That's how you observe how your mind conjures stress for itself. 

I'm sorry to hear about what you've had to endure. Unfortunately the past must be accepted for what it is, there's no changing it no matter what. The only thing you can do with it is accept that it happened. That doesn't make it right, and your mom is foolish for causing her child so much suffering without truly seeing it. 

&gt;but at every turn of my life, those memories are always there in the back of my mind. i swear i am really trying to move past them. but they seem to affect every single thing i do, even subconsciously, unintentionally 

that sounds similar to post-traumatic stress which is expected after someone endures trauma. 

here is a bit of info about karma, and how past karma isn't as important as what we do now in the present moment. This is where the Dhamma shines. 

&gt;For the early Buddhists, karma was non-linear and complex. Other Indian schools believed that karma operated in a simple straight line, with actions from the past influencing the present, and present actions influencing the future. As a result, they saw little room for free will. Buddhists, however, saw that karma acts in multiple feedback loops, with the present moment being shaped both by past and by present actions; present actions shape not only the future but also the present. Furthermore, present actions need not be determined by past actions. In other words, there is free will, although its range is somewhat dictated by the past. The nature of this freedom is symbolized in an image used by the early Buddhists: flowing water. Sometimes the flow from the past is so strong that little can be done except to stand fast, but there are also times when the flow is gentle enough to be diverted in almost any direction.  
&gt;  
&gt;So, instead of promoting resigned powerlessness, the early Buddhist notion of karma focused on the liberating potential of what the mind is doing with every moment. Who you are ‚Äî what you come from ‚Äî is not anywhere near as important as the mind's motives for what it is doing right now. Even though the past may account for many of the inequalities we see in life, our measure as human beings is not the hand we've been dealt, for that hand can change at any moment. We take our own measure by how well we play the hand we've got. If you're suffering, you try not to continue the unskillful mental habits that would keep that particular karmic feedback going.","take care of yourself. start with that. in every way, take care of your spiritual, emotional, mental, and physical state.

what you've experienced is terrible, and i am sorry that you have suffered it.

finding a way of contextualising it so that you can let it go - for your sake, not anyone else's - is essential. you do not want to live with anger in your heart. you want peace. you deserve peace.

one way of contextualising this from a buddhist perspective is in a framework of karma - you have been born with the parents and family you have because of karma. some attachment, either positive or negative, has conditioned you to be born there with those beings surrounding you. accept that according to the buddha, that must be the result of some action you performed in a past life. 

it sounds like you would never perform such actions in this life, so what you have done here and now in this life, is extinguish that unwholesome karma. it is gone, done, dealt with.

also keep in mind that hatred is a bond that can tie people together across lifetimes, just as much as love can. it's possible that you hated your mother in a past lifetime, and that attachment has conditioned this birth. if you do not wish to be reborn again with these people around you, develop equanimity towards them - become indifferent to them. do you pack hate into your karmic baggage, or you may end up taking these same people with you into future lifetimes.

to let go, practice the brahmaviharas: loving kindness, compassion, altruistic joy, and equanimity. these four are your tools for maintaining and developing your mind, even in the midst of a life that has suffering through it. 

with loving kindness, start with yourself. have compassion for yourself. be gentle with yourself. be kind to yourself. love yourself and the emotions that arise in you (even the hate) as little children, screaming out for your care and attention. hate is a conditioned emotion - it arises in response to some event. so having respect for that original event or trauma is important. have kindness and compassion for your hate. it is there for a reason, and to have care for that emotion is to have respect for the original event or trauma that you experienced.

loving kindness mindfulness will be essential practice for you. these are the instructions i have used.

it sounds like you're familiar with with the Buddha's original teaching on loving kindness, but i'll link it and the brahmaviharas here.:

best of luck. given what you've described, i would suggest that you also get some professional  and personal support if that is practical in your country. you'll need to develop friends and a network to replace your family - perhaps if there's a temple in your area, you can start there and befriend a few monks / laypeople, to talk to. you may also want to speak to someone professionally to make sure you get supported properly. 

finally, in buddhism, forgiveness is something you beg of another when you have done something wrong. in your case, if your mother / family have not acknowledged any wrong towards you, you cannot forgive them - they have not asked for your forgiveness. if they do not acknowledge any wrong towards you, were you to tell them that you forgive them for their actions, they would likely get angry with you. 

you need not forgive them to heal from this. you only need to have love and compassion in your own heart, and leave them to theirs.

be well - find true happiness. stay safe - you have a universe of other mothers, fathers, bothers and sisters, who you have loved and who have loved and treated you kindly in past lives. this is just one lifetime - focus on the love, kindness and compassion, and you will find your way back to your true family.",,,,,,,,,,
